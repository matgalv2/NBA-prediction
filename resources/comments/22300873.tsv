TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I can't remember the last time to see both teams scored under 90 points
	Kim Ferlon shooting was horrible, both teams shot under 39% from the field... Happy Clippers got the W tho
	Norti Wriot is either the both teams play worse or both teams play good defense.
	Nice good play kakawhi💪🏀💛
	Clippers - Celtics for the championship
	Wade Siers A Lakers nightmare
	Wade Siers really ?....
	good defense by the clippers
	Classic score, love it!
	How many layups did the clippers get away with fouls on? I know it’s a tough job but the officiating has to be better. At the very least that should’ve been an overtime game
	By the look on his face, he's about to win this chip!
	Kawhi Leonard had him a game for the Los Angeles Clippers
	This man is very very healthy this season. When he's in that situation that means title in summer.
	😅😅😅
	Esther Lee yeah remember in Toronto. No one gave him credit. He's gonna be more stronger in the playoffs
	Didi Jones wow..I wish he gets more stronger, can you add me I get some few questions on him to ask you pls
	Didi Jones Message me with your left hand for your
	🏆 this season, to test their accurate prediction because the season seems to be tight
	Didi Jones then how come they lost to a team from LA led by a 39 year old player?
	Ferdinand Untalan defense brother. Next time they won't have that opportunity to come back and win.
	Esther Lee No problem ask here.
	That scoreline indicates defense was played, that's rare and looks like a fiba or 90s/00s scoreline when basketball was worth watching
	It doesn't matter if they were in top 6 as we all know that season is different from Play-offs,it is because in a best of 7 match! Superstar always matter.
	So we gonna ignore James Harden at the end 😂
	Kawhi looks so happy
	This would've been considered a high scoring game in the 90's. 😏
	West finals represent 🔥🔥🔥🏆🏆🏆
	Bro I remember when Zubac was posterized in the first we was down 14-2 😭
	Meanwhile Celtics had 82 points by half-time 😆
	AJ Johnson they played a bum team
	Now this is a REAL basketball score.
	😭
	Nathan Indombe it is called playing defense. Much better basketball.
	Warriors scored 88 and they lost also, against Celtics (140)!
	wow when was the last time we saw a score like this?
	Glad to see some defense. Sad to see the Wolves not win it. Should have shot a 3 in the end.
	Why did the Antman score a deuce on the final possession? Must’ve been super excited to go home and see his baby.
	Sean Somera defense
	Anthony Davis kick out assist wasn’t available? Honest question.
	Sean Somera no pg guarded him. Kawhi was on Kat I think.  Really good defense from the clippers
	Sean Somera wats good bout the clippers they don’t need to double. They have 2 top tier defenders in pg and kawhi.
	Anthony Davis yep. Just saw it.
	Terrible game by both teams
	Wayne Roberson nah just defensive game
	Brandon Rankin both teams shot like 30%. Terrible.  Kawai and Powell only one to play half way
	Wayne Roberson shid again. Defense
	Brandon Rankin ok…couldn’t wait for the game to end.
	Wayne Roberson nobody cares what you couldn’t wait for
	Brandon Rankin i care
	Brandon Rankin  cat and naz went like 0-20 shooting open 3s. That’s not cause of good defense
	Wayne Roberson well my guys won so I don’t care
	See y’all got lucky see can y’all win a chip wit it😭😭😭😭
	Score of 2000’s😍😍
	Denver now has a chance to take #1 seed
	Two best defensive team in NBA going at each other..... Loved 😍 it
	Hate to say it but as a nuggets fan we needed this.
	Real basketball final score.
	These are the scores I want to see. Under 100 points
	Finally teams played defense!
	This is the type of basketball I miss
	Yes go clippers
	Ain't seen a game with a score like this in a long time
	A defensive game…. Hallelujah
	Congrats Clippers Nice game God bless🙏🙏💪🏀🏀
	good
	The nuggets thank you!
	You lose the game against veteran players Clippers, Edward, so what more can you say?
	That's the real happy face of Kawhi.😅
	By 1 point is crazy ngl, but clippers have a W roster, Paul George, Kawhi and Joel that is unstoppable!
	Wolves played badly but the refs don’t help. Too star struck to make calls out there
	silent assassin, his play do the talking, not his mouth.
	Hahaa what ant Edward said before, the LA Clippers players are already old and no match to them 😂🤣
	The Timberwolves are crumbling at the wrong time. Reminds of those Hawks teams that got the 1st seed and the lost to Lebron in the East.
	😍😍
	Norman Power
	Thank you clippers 🙂
	But defense is dead.........
	Did two teams play defense? Wow I didn't think they were doing that this year 🤣
	That’s some bad shooting
	another good news😇
	Dude will never smile 😭
	Comeback after being blown out in the first.
	Basketball played at both ends 🔥
	Where's the Old? 😁💯
	This is a basketball when both teams have defence. 🙂
	What is this sorcery? Lol that’s gotta be the first game where no one got over 90 all year lol Josh Marshall
	Josh I didn’t watch but I wonder if it was due to defense or horrid shot making lol
	Best in the World
	Its a matter of time game will reach 200+ points
	The claw moves
	Great job
	Ha ha..they(t'wolves)called them old
	Just remember: I'm a fun guy. Heeeunhhh huiuehhh- Translation in Google=Laughs
	the i.prone😂✌
	Who are you? I'm kaway lenard
	He was the Karati Kid before
	Best team in all LA 
	When they playing the 2nd half?
	Good job
	Clippers will get to Western Conference final

	Low scoring game. Defense on both sides was on point.
	Harden offered up a playoff preview 😂
	Scott Kruitbosch you just mad
	Brandon Rankin about what? You’re just repeating a trite and hollow phrase as if he’s family for inexplicable reasons
