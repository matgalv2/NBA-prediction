	Orlando Magic Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
	His brother, M should be depicted here instead with a game high of 22 off the bench!
	Rzet Nicolas
	No other player with better stats?
	Chia Yong Kang his brother Mo scored 22 from the bench
	Chia Yong Kang what if he got the last 10 points of the Magic? That changes everything
	Cavs soft like Charmin ðŸ§»
	Just watched the game, great teamplay. Nice win.
	Letâ€™s go Magic ðŸª„

	So 14/4/4 was the best in the game? Who designated his 14 as the edge for the win? Both are rhetorical for the internet professors compelled to answer. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥´
	Nah, starters sucked tonight. Shouldve shouted out his older bro Moâ€™ and the bench. They carried the team to the win tonight.
	Franz Wagner
