	Oklahoma is no joke, best team I've seen in a long time. See how they do in playoffs when the time comes.
	Aww Celtics won. They gained zero ground

	 uh it's for the lead in the league, if they meet in the finals.

	 wrong. The team with the most wins outright, gets home court through the finals
	Stop watching ESPN. It rots your brain.
	 and does this post say anything about the Celtics not being number 1? They have been 1 all season long so shut your trap. This post is about okc beating totonto and you wanna yap about the Celtics. Foh
