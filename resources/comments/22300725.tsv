TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
MIL	Tough luck! But the Bucks are a resilient team! I’m sure Doc Rivers will use his championship experience to help Giannis and the crew secure a Heat in 4 instead of a Heat in 5!  😤😩😭☠️🤣
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Phoenix Suns
MIL	We should see an RDCworld Doc Rivers video.
	Serkan Karatepe hello 👋
	Thursday, February 8, 2024 NBA Regular Season Schedule (Philippines Time) 7 Games 
MIL	Doc Rivers is going to have one of the shortest seasons ever.
	🏀
MIL	Thanasis will replace doc rivers for head coach position per Giannis 🤣
PHX	Well done, suns!!
MIL	Dame needs to be healthy to play like we need him to. He’s taken 106 more threes than Beasley and only made 6 more than him…and Beasley doesn’t even shoot 50%
MIL	Keep the losses coming for the Bucks. 🤣 That'll show them for firing AG when he was producing a winning season!
MIL	Doc still doing the Celtics a favour!
PHX	Devin Booker the finest
MIL	They hired Doc for this sheet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
PHX	Yeah Phoenix Suns get winner in the game .. congrats KD and team .. bravo
	Edževid Sunsi sve bolji, a u Milwaukeeju Doc efekt..
MIL	Doc Rivers doing Doc Rivers stuff
	Kevin durant 28points
	Nää Sön KD... potential for so much MORE!!
PHX	Nice 1 suns congrats 👍
PHX	Nice game with big Trio
	🔥🏀🔥
MIL	What's up doc?🤣
MIL	Adrian was the problem i see😂😂😂😂
	My sumpa ata si coach ah
	🏀🏀
	💯💪🎯🏀🌄🌞🔥💥☝️❤️🏆👏🎊🎉
MIL	No dame kris or lopez for the bucks. The defense was better overall solid game.
	Joshua Garcia But I can see your tears
	Joshua Garcia copium
	Joshua Garcia bucks should get the win next game dame should be back
	Joshua Garcia Suns just would’ve played that much better and still would’ve won. They were coasting and you know it
MIL	They can have Lopez, Dame and Kris and lose to Hornets the next game. It's basketball.
	Joshua Garcia yeah but doc rivers is still your coach
	Joshua Garcia 😭😭😭
	Joshua Garcia whatever you have to tell yourself son
	You don't know the game ... lol ....  nothing but loser talk
MIL	Yeah Adrian Griffin was the problem
	This season:
MIL	Bucks shot themselves in the the legs with Doc rivers
	😅😅😅 Suns vs Giannis please !! No Lopez, Dame and Middleton
PHX	Good win suns but with Booker playing like this the team wont go far, how can u only have 4 Asp playing pointguard with likes of KD,Beal, and a shooter like Allan and Gordan 💁‍♂️.
PHX	That stat line is wrong book had 32 durant 28 with 10 reb
PHX	Why not “KD’s 32 points”? 😏
MIL	doc rivers is on playoff mode already, putting the league on notice.
PHX	I think the caption is an problem🤣👍kevin or booker in 32 pts..
MIL	People blaming Doc like the Bucks haven't been falling apart before he got there....
	Reggie Demmons Hello how are you doing
MIL	DOC Rivers is cooking
	Hanggang game 6 Lang nman Yan SUNS nyo sa bucks 🤣 2021 champion bucks .beat the Sun's🤪
PHX	KD only had 28 , spell check NBA
MIL	Ohh.. doc is in trouble
MIL	How do you like him now, Giannis!?!?
	bwakaw yan   gusto sapawan  c durant  at maging lider ng team
	Dondi Atilebas hahahaha Gunggong
	Isaiah Cody Of course you jinxed it and the Bucks lost...🤣
