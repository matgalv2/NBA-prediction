TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Tough luck! But the Bucks are a resilient team! I’m sure Doc Rivers will use his championship experience to help Giannis and the crew secure a Heat in 4 instead of a Heat in 5!  😤😩😭☠️🤣
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Phoenix Suns
	We should see an RDCworld Doc Rivers video.
	Serkan Karatepe hello 👋
	Thursday, February 8, 2024 NBA Regular Season Schedule (Philippines Time) 7 Games 
	Doc Rivers is going to have one of the shortest seasons ever.
	🏀
	Thanasis will replace doc rivers for head coach position per Giannis 🤣
	Well done, suns!!
	Dame needs to be healthy to play like we need him to. He’s taken 106 more threes than Beasley and only made 6 more than him…and Beasley doesn’t even shoot 50%
	Keep the losses coming for the Bucks. 🤣 That'll show them for firing AG when he was producing a winning season!
	Doc still doing the Celtics a favour!
	Devin Booker the finest
	They hired Doc for this sheet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Yeah Phoenix Suns get winner in the game .. congrats KD and team .. bravo
	Edževid Sunsi sve bolji, a u Milwaukeeju Doc efekt..
	Doc Rivers doing Doc Rivers stuff
	Kevin durant 28points
	Nää Sön KD... potential for so much MORE!!
	Nice 1 suns congrats 👍
	Nice game with big Trio
	🔥🏀🔥
	What's up doc?🤣
	Adrian was the problem i see😂😂😂😂
	My sumpa ata si coach ah
	🏀🏀
	💯💪🎯🏀🌄🌞🔥💥☝️❤️🏆👏🎊🎉
	No dame kris or lopez for the bucks. The defense was better overall solid game. 
	Joshua Garcia But I can see your tears
	Joshua Garcia copium
	Joshua Garcia bucks should get the win next game dame should be back
	Joshua Garcia Suns just would’ve played that much better and still would’ve won. They were coasting and you know it
	They can have Lopez, Dame and Kris and lose to Hornets the next game. It's basketball.
	Joshua Garcia yeah but doc rivers is still your coach
	Joshua Garcia 😭😭😭
	Joshua Garcia whatever you have to tell yourself son
	You don't know the game ... lol ....  nothing but loser talk
	Yeah Adrian Griffin was the problem
	This season:
	Bucks shot themselves in the the legs with Doc rivers
	😅😅😅 Suns vs Giannis please !! No Lopez, Dame and Middleton
	Good win suns but with Booker playing like this the team wont go far, how can u only have 4 Asp playing pointguard with likes of KD,Beal, and a shooter like Allan and Gordan 💁‍♂️.
	That stat line is wrong book had 32 durant 28 with 10 reb
	Why not “KD’s 32 points”? 😏 
	doc rivers is on playoff mode already, putting the league on notice.
	I think the caption is an problem🤣👍kevin or booker in 32 pts..
	People blaming Doc like the Bucks haven't been falling apart before he got there....
	Reggie Demmons Hello how are you doing
	DOC Rivers is cooking
	Hanggang game 6 Lang nman Yan SUNS nyo sa bucks 🤣 2021 champion bucks .beat the Sun's🤪
	KD only had 28 , spell check NBA
	Ohh.. doc is in trouble
	How do you like him now, Giannis!?!?
	bwakaw yan   gusto sapawan  c durant  at maging lider ng team
	Dondi Atilebas hahahaha Gunggong
	Isaiah Cody Of course you jinxed it and the Bucks lost...🤣
	They should fire Bucks' coach.. he ain't deliverin..

	Nangangamoy sipa  na naman si Doc Rivers ah
	Meanwhile to everyone that's reading this, am an RnB singer and wish to be followed by you 🙏🏼would really appreciate 💕
	Giannis was terrible in the 1st quarter.. came back nicely though but lost without their defensive anchor and dame
	KD has 28pts / 10 reb
	Jrue holiday effects 👍🏻
	Good game!!
	Dame needs to be traded he fuccing up the bucks core every since he got there I don’t like the squad no more
	Bookem !!!! Let’s Go Suns !
	Half the team gone? 
	Big win Boyz. Book Em ☄️☄️☄️☄️

	"I just noticed that those people that are always commenting ""first round exit/second round exit"" in these NBA posts are stupid bandwagon filipino fans that know nothing about basketball they are jealous to the top teams because their favorite teams are 💩"
	Gotta feel sorry for GIANNIS 😥
	Things are kinda tough at the moment, especially this time of the year so l’m gifting $5,000 to the first 10 people to message me with “GOD DID” it’s a golden opportunity, stay blessed y’all.
