	LeBron James is the Greatest of all time next to MJ, Steph, Kobe, and Duncan..
	Yes!  What a great regular season!  Now, time to win Banner #18!  Let’s go Celtics!  ☘️☘️☘️☘️
	He is as valuable as Boston's starters
	Awesome job P-Rabbit ☘🏀💚
	Career best, actually
	I just hope He gets more playing time in the playoffs
	Basically Jalen Brunson..put him on a team where het the starter he'd put up similar numbers
	Tommy's Award Winner of all times!!
	Boston bench could be the key in their playoff run, apart of the starting 5.
	  Could be.... There are one of the best in the league dude
	 regular season proves that. Currently, they're the best team in basketball.
	Congratulations Boston Celtics team and fans on the victory
	He might be the next Jalen Brunson pretty soon… storyline wise
	The Brunson of Boston
	Yhhh... This is why Tatum cant win MVP.
	Celts need this in the playoffs
	This game looked like a preseason game!

	Mac Cardona. 🔥😅
	1st round exit
	
	D. White better step it up or he’s gone sooner than later 👀
	"Triple P is on fire again🔥 Payton""Payback""Pritchard"
	Pritchard can score in spurts, but in the long run, his in ability to play
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	People don’t realize how good this kid is
	Good job and great game .. congrats for my team idol celtics wins .. always success for you alk team celtics always healthy always happy with family with you fans and god bless you team celtics .. enjoy you day ♥

	Well Celtics should’ve beaten them.
	Potentially an unpopular opinion but he’s better than Austin Reeves 🤷‍♂️
	Congratulations 🎉
	This guy could be a true C factor on a playoff run

	Now how did I know he was a Celtic without reading the blurb? 🤣
	Pritchard is the goat now LeBron scores all of this he's the goat everyone wants be mj but all the have the heart
	He gone end up leaving most likely he’s too good to be on the bench
	One game one game short of 65 wins one game
	only celtics fans know how good P-Rabbit is… kid scored 92 in a pro am game casually
