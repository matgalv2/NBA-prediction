TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
WAS	Well I got the results of wizard and hornets against our bench backwards. I figured wizards would've been blown out and hornets kind of competed to an extent. Yet this proves just how good our bench really is. Payton Pritchard starts on at least half the teams in the NBA I'm just saying
BOS	Yes!  What a great regular season!  Now, time to win Banner #18!  Let’s go Celtics!  ☘️☘️☘️☘️
WAS	😒😭
BOS	He is as valuable as Boston's starters
BOS	Layla Luna he has a left hand unlike someone else that’s a starter
BOS	Layla Luna Boston fans love their little PP, but trust me, he can't play big minutes as a starter. He can't defend larger guys at all.
	LeBron James is the Greatest of all time next to MJ, Steph, Kobe, and Duncan..
	Jonel Campuso no one asked...
	Jonel Campuso steph isn’t top 5 . Bron isn’t top 3 .
	Jonel Campuso why would you even leave THAT here...this stalking the king...just thinking about him when the post has absolutely NOTHING to do with him is scary..why would ANOTHER MAN be on your mind like THAT?Y'all weird
	Career best, actually
BOS	Awesome job P-Rabbit ☘🏀💚
	Jackie Olsen
BOS	I just hope He gets more playing time in the playoffs
BOS	Basically Jalen Brunson..put him on a team where het the starter he'd put up similar numbers
	Leonard Teague I agree
	Leonard Teague I've been calling him a poor mans Jaylen brunson all season!...I agree 100%
	Tommy's Award Winner of all times!!
BOS	Boston bench could be the key in their playoff run, apart of the starting 5.
	André da Silva  Could be.... There are one of the best in the league dude
BOS	Marshall James regular season proves that. Currently, they're the best team in basketball.
BOS	The Brunson of Boston
BOS	He might be the next Jalen Brunson pretty soon… storyline wise
BOS	Congratulations Boston Celtics team and fans on the victory
	Quel excellent joueur qui progresse année après année!!
BOS	Yhhh... This is why Tatum cant win MVP.
	Glodas Matondo exactly, 3 dudes no one has heard of scoring 90pts is crazy lol
BOS	This game looked like a preseason game!
BOS	This guy is underrated in this league.
BOS	Wow, that’s big bro. Respect.
BOS	now how the Celtics beat the Wizards but the Bucks couldn't lol 😂
	MaskOn DemonBaby the Celtics bench*
	MaskOn DemonBaby the celtics g league squad plus sam &amp; peyton*

BOS	Celts need this in the playoffs
BOS	Love seeing the bench thrive
BOS	He finally gettin shine I member wen buddy was goin crazy in the summer leagues cookin everybody
	Nice one mac cardona 🔥
BOS	man just one rebound could change it
	Mac Cardona. 🔥😅
	1st round exit
	Sviiii
	D. White better step it up or he’s gone sooner than later 👀
	Pritchard can score in spurts, but in the long run, his in ability to play
BOS	"Triple P is on fire again🔥 Payton""Payback""Pritchard"
BOS	People don’t realize how good this kid is
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	🤣
	Manando Atm Cebza what dreams you have
	Manando Atm Cebza the haters' heads would explode lol
	Manando Atm Cebza So… Lakers are getting by the Nuggets??? Mmmmk!!!!
BOS	Very poor on the last quarter....shame on Celtics for 4th quarter 🌛
BOS	Good job and great game .. congrats for my team idol celtics wins .. always success for you alk team celtics always healthy always happy with family with you fans and god bless you team celtics .. enjoy you day ♥
BOS	Well Celtics should’ve beaten them.
BOS	Potentially an unpopular opinion but he’s better than Austin Reeves 🤷‍♂️
BOS	This guy could be a true C factor on a playoff run
BOS	Congratulations 🎉
	Things are kinda tough atm especially this time of the year so l’m going gifting 5 grands to the first 7 people to message me with “GRACE” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.
BOS	Great performance 🎭
BOS	Kid is really good
BOS	This Boston Celtics team should be 75-7. Smh.
BOS	Lourenço R. Pires I’d say more like 68-14 easy
	Simon Oliver, they were something like 5-10 in close games. Smh.
	Lourenço R. Pires yes poor execution down the stretch but, I look at close games/OT as toss ups so they should be like 8-7 in those games.
	Il est en feu hein
	Washington Wizards Vs Boston Celtics

BOS	Now how did I know he was a Celtic without reading the blurb? 🤣
BOS	Pritchard is the goat now LeBron scores all of this he's the goat everyone wants be mj but all the have the heart
BOS	He gone end up leaving most likely he’s too good to be on the bench
	One game one game short of 65 wins one game
BOS	Antonio Weeks so what? We won one more game than 63
BOS	Tim Keough nobody has won 65 games in a while so yes it kinda matters because I thought they would
BOS	Antonio Weeks a totally meaningless statistic when you already have the overall number one seed. There is one accomplishment that matters, and we all know what that is
	Tim Keough never said it matters
BOS	Tim Keough was it important that Celtics won 65 games? No. Did I want to see it? Yes do I think they should have gotten it? Yes. This my comment I think they're winning the title regardless. And it will matter when ranking all time teams
BOS	only celtics fans know how good P-Rabbit is… kid scored 92 in a pro am game casually
BOS	Payton is a dog
	"THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING  OUT THOSE FACING CHALLENGES THIS MONTH, I'II SUPPORT SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH 5 GRAND WHO WRITES TO ME USING THE PHRASE ""STRUGGLING”"
