TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	We are lucky to have players like Alperen Green and Jalen Şengün in our team 🙌🏻
	Uğur Duranay hhhhhhhhhh
	This editor should be fired🤣Alperen Green🤣
	Alperen Green &amp; Jalen Sengun onfireeee 🔥🔥
	Alperen Green is good 😂😂😂
	Thats the future of all time great center folks.
	Be better NBA. Official account is a joke and can't even get the player's name right. Disrespectful
	Honestly wish there were two games on ASG weekend. One game for the main all star game and one game for the guys like him who will fringe on being an all star. There are plenty of people to choose from!
	this guy gonna be an all star soon. i think he should have been an all star this year.
	This turkish man is good
	Alperen Green? Really?
	Sengun is an Allstar!!!
	Isaac De La Cerda not yet,but possibly next season.
	Michael William Cassidy crazy look up his stats
	Isaac De La Cerda The Rockets are in 11th place man,hard to put a player in the All-Star game when his team isn’t doing good. He’s a good up and coming player,if the Rockets keep adding to their team and win more games next season he’ll probably make it.
	Michael William Cassidy Lol while Lebron, Curry and AD has spot in allstar while they are in 9th and 12th spot. So if were going to based on team success and individual stats this year. Sabonis should must be over AD tho. Also De aaron Fox over Curry too
	Michael William Cassidy so why LB and AD in the Allstar game?
	Isaac De La Cerda Lakers have a better record than the Rockets and AD has won an MVP and championship,he’s more popular man. And Lebron is Lebron you already know he’s the most popular player in the league and has all the accolades,there’s no way they’d leave him out of the All-Star game.
	Michael William Cassidy All Star voting was popularity vote thats all. Look at Wiggins when he was included on All star starter on 2022
	Matthew Kua Pellejera The fans aren’t the only people who vote bro. And it’s rare that a player from a team who’s at the bottom of their conference makes the All-Star game.
	Michael William Cassidy Its Popularity vote thats all. How in the hell Sabonis and Fox was not included in all star this year then. They have better stats than AD and Curry tho. Also their team was 5th spot compared to Lakers and Warriors who was on 9th and 12th spot
	Matthew Kua Pellejera Fox should’ve definitely made it,Sabonis didn’t have a chance too many better big men than him in the West.
	Michael William Cassidy AD never has won an mvp bro
	Trey Lane All-Star game MVP my boy.
	Michael William Cassidy jalen green 40+ point per game last season 🤔
	Marion F Saron Losing team.
	Michael William Cassidy I know, you never stated all star though… having a previous all star mvp has no correlation of making it this year.. Westbrook and Kyrie have been all star mvps should they be in the all star game this year?
	Trey Lane I hear you but AD is still one of the best bigs in the West,you know and I know he wasn’t gonna be left out the All-Star game. He’s averaging 24.9pts / 12.1 REB on 55.4% FG. I’m not even a AD fan,but he belongs in the All-Star game.
	Michael William Cassidy I know he’s a beast
	Isaac De La Cerda Better Than KAT
	Isaac De La Cerda clearly… that’s why the NBA knows his name so well
	They call him the Soul Man, Al Green, for short! 😁
	Alperen Green? Really?
	Nice game Alperen Green🔥
	He deserve all star 2024
	Alperen green
	If he was in the warriors it be a wrap 🙄
	Alperen Green 😩
	This guy should be in the all star line up.
	Alperen green 😭
	Nagpakasal na pla si sengun ky jalen green 🎂

	Tasman Myles i want him back 🤦🏾
	Dean Hopkins
	Alperen Green Marcus Tenenbaum Declan NoronhaLachlan Simmons
	Jem Coppin they still haven't changed it
	All star snub
	Jalperen Sengreen
	Who in the hell is Alperen Green?
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	Good thing it is not 'Cam Quickley', admin!
	Alperen Sengun
	Chito Rock Brodie….. IQ and RJ still not making the Raptors any better. What’s going on??? Meanwhile the Knicks are on a “9” game winning streak,the longest in the NBA and sitting comfortably in 3rd place.
	Michael William Cassidy bro over doing becuase toronto has all young players and they in a major rebuild , the trade talks are pretty much over and done with . I juat hope thibs is the next one traded
	Chito Rock In fairness,Thibs just won coach of the month. The Knicks only lost 2 games in January. And if RJ and IQ were as good as you say they are they would’ve had an immediate impact on the team rebuild or not.
	Michael William Cassidy bro both players been out , and ok the trade has worked out here but dont let these wins get over your head so quickly, the playoffs is a different game . And what a coincidence that we have 3 injured players? 2 wont be back til playoffs and the other who knows . Thibs runs his players through the ground , the last 2 blowouts he had brunson playing while we was up by more than 16 with 3 minutes left to go lol we already down and he's tampering with our star player .
	Michael William Cassidy enjoy the wins and stop worrying about RJ and IQ , arent you happy they Gone ? So why sweat them so much .
	Chito Rock Randle didn’t get hurt because of Thibs man,that was a freak injury. And the Knicks are the best defensive team in the league,no team in the East wants to play us in a 7 game series. We’re 1 Bucks loss away from 2nd place and then we’re going after the Celtics. The Celtics couldn’t even beat the Lakers without Lebron and AD.
	Chito Rock Because you said it wasn’t a good trade and that it wasn’t RJ’s fault why the Knicks weren’t playing good which was clearly wrong.
	Michael William Cassidy its not RJs fault bro , dont be stubborn and realize that he wasnt put to succeed here anymore
	Chito Rock I completely disagree. The second RJ was gone the Knicks instantly started winning and became the best defensive team in the NBA,that’s not a coincidence. RJ was hurting the Knicks badly on both ends of the court,that was clear as day to see… Wyświetl więcej
	Michael William Cassidy thats becuase the offense goes through goes through randall and brunson and other players get to score without requiring the ball . Understand the game not the trade
	Chito Rock RJ was taking 20 shots a game most nights man,he just was shooting a horrible percentage. There’s a reason he’s gone,and the Raptors are still awful and the Knicks instantly transformed into one of the best teams in the NBA. Great trade that needed to happen for the Knicks to have success.
	Michael William Cassidy they doing it and thats what matters , im over the trade and its time to go
	Chito Rock Now you’re talking.
	Michael William Cassidy josh hart cant score for his life , I thought OG was bad
	Chito Rock I have to say he hasn’t been great offensively lately,but his rebounding and defense is necessary off the bench. Knicks are missing Randle,OG,Grimes,Robinson. At full strength they’re gonna be a problem for any team in the playoffs.
	Chito Rock And OG isn’t bad offensively you just keep saying that cause you’re still hurt they traded your brick boy RJ
	Michael William Cassidy RJ is better offensively
	Chito Rock RJ is a terrible percentage shooter,he takes awful shots,he messes up the flow of the offense,OG takes better shots and he’s a better percentage shooter and a waaaaayyy better defender. OG is the better player man,and a champion on top of it.
	Michael William Cassidy your OG needs surgery, you see what i mean
	Chito Rock He’s still better than RJ.
	Michael William Cassidy yea he is and RJ has played in 1 year more rhan hes played in 3 , reliability's over mon reliable anytime
	Michael William Cassidy toronto did us dirty , i told you all that hype for nothing and now we gotta trade for a player like him
	Chito Rock It’s still a good trade. They’re gonna sign him in the Summer,he’s in his prime. One of the best on ball defenders in the league. RJ is not making the Raptors any better,in fact they might be worse with RJ than they were without him.
	Michael William Cassidy whats a player in his prime if he cant play now ? This is a business not a museum. And they just traded grimes and picks for alec burk lol what circus now
	Chito Rock I like that Grimes trade. I wasn’t a fan of Grimes,way too inconsistent just like RJ. Burks knows the system that Thibs runs,he’ll come in and fit right in right away. And OG will be fine,he’s in his prime and one of the best defenders in the league,great trade for the Knicks.
	Michael William Cassidy like i said we need him now not next season
	Chito Rock Injuries are a part of the game man,that could happen to anyone,look at Embiid. It’s still a good trade no matter how you look at it,they traded away a bad percentage shooter and horrible defender for a good percentage shooter and great defender.
	Michael William Cassidy OG is an amazing player but sucks with his injuries the most hes ever played was 62 games his rookie season 🤣🤣🤣
	Chito Rock He’s not the only player in the NBA who plays 62 games a season. Go look how many games Ben Simmons plays every year.
	Chito Rock Knicks got Bogdonovic too.
	Toronto Raptors Vs Houston Rockets
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
	For a second i thought i was reading a theScore post, does nobody on sports social media double check before hitting enter.
	why did jalen green play 40+ games last season even now jg's 37 points season high now.. meanwhile shengun has less than half of jalen's points but analysts are praising shengun in allstar? Are Pinoys in America racist 😂 or Americans just don't accept that Filipinos are really better? what a shame you all americans 😂
	The NBA has the worst social media staff lol
	The disrespect is CRIMINAL!
	they can do dillon van vleet next.
	Alperen green….what a player 🤣
	My guyyyy
	Great win
	Him and Jalen married now?
