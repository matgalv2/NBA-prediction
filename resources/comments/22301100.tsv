	Cleveland Cavaliers Vs Utah Jazz
	Cavs casuals and homers can't see it but what else do you need to see to realize Garland is a role player on a max contract? He is a non factor in wins and a driving factor in losses. He's overrated, overvalued and overpaid. You're not a contender until you move him

	Caris LeVert was the man for Cleveland Cavaliers
	Cavs is an unbalanced team, this team will never win anything
