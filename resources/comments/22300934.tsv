	STill the best Small foward
	Nice Bro,, just stay in good health and good condition u can surpass the Legend of Basketball 👍
	They should've blown the Cavs out. The Suns are 🗑️
	 lol such a weak take. I have to assume this is the first NBA game you’ve watched all season if you think point differential means anything. Btw, this same Cavs team just beat the Celtics a few games ago.
	  The reason I made the statement was that Donovan Mitchell wasn't playing. The C's are just a 😢 case
	Struggling against a team missing three starters.
	Phoenix Suns Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
	Without 3 Cavs starters. They struggled to win this game.
	 Then Garland out for a few Thank goodness it wasn’t that bad.
	 need those three back soon.
	 For real! I wish everyone was healthy! They would be quite a dangerous team like Kenny Smith said!
	Still be great for KD 👍👏.
	KD will always score.....👊🏽
	Kevin is so strong!
	"Kevin ""The Durable"" Durant"
	Way to come back from down 19. Good to have Book back☄️☄️☄️
	Kevin Durant
	Kd now time to go for those triple doubles or double double you are averaging the 35 I said you can make go for it swagger.
	💯
	KD a.k.a Mr Slim Reaper onfireee 🔥🔥
	Can kd carry the suns in the nba finals
	Ppl gotta say negative about Kevin Durant or LeBron James, but if Luka Doncic does similar statistics,  it's over-celebrated 
	he didn't do long 🔥 like Lebron james
	hope the SUNS can improve in their last games in regular season
	good man
	Kevin don't stop
	But did they look like a team tonight???
	Congrats KD
	congrats suns
	better than lbj
