	Nice Bro,, just stay in good health and good condition u can surpass the Legend of Basketball 👍
	They should've blown the Cavs out. The Suns are 🗑️
	Corey Martin lol such a weak take. I have to assume this is the first NBA game you’ve watched all season if you think point differential means anything. Btw, this same Cavs team just beat the Celtics a few games ago.
	😢 case
	Corey Martin booker juss came back
	🤣
	😢
	Phoenix Suns Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
	Without 3 Cavs starters. They struggled to win this game.
	David Wilkins Then Garland out for a few Thank goodness it wasn’t that bad.
	Terrie Lynn Damron Hillyer need those three back soon.
	David Wilkins For real! I wish everyone was healthy! They would be quite a dangerous team like Kenny Smith said!
	David Wilkins definitely a cavs fan
	Still won’t ever win a ring without curry klay and dray

	Devin Michael Stone  keep you fingers crossed for them to make the playoffs! Lol

	Can kd carry the suns in the nba finals
	yes,kd is the best Cavs is loser team always
	Ppl gotta say negative about Kevin Durant or LeBron James, but if Luka Doncic does similar statistics,  it's over-celebrated 
	Ngol 😍🥰
	he didn't do long 🔥 like Lebron james
	hope the SUNS can improve in their last games in regular season
	In 2020, Allen Iverson penned a tribute to his friend, Kobe. 💜
