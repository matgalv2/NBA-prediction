TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	So inspiring. A team with 4 superstars won 1 point against a team without their superstar.
	RK Aloivag Tyrese Maxey is better than Harden and Westbrook but I see your point
LAC	No one but the refs won the game. They even admitted they missed the KO call to end the game. 😡
	Karen Rose bad calls both ways Philly were up by 15 and leading most the game they should of won by 5+
	Caine McClelland maybe. But PG knocked that ball out and then Kelly got fouled. So two bad calls. Never should come down to that, but it did.
	Karen Rose if u watch the replay closely Kelly right fingers touches the ball last the last play  however a missed call
	🤷🏻‍♀️
	🤣🤣
	🤣🤣🤣did you watch it I have the recording in my snap memories stop it
	Isaac Nezz the refs ADMITTED it to the press after the game. So no.
	🤣🤣🤣I’m not finna argue wit a Karen 🤦🏽hands never came down over the body not one time they both went up idc what the reffs said good win for my team get outa here 💪🏾
	Isaac Nezz it's already in print. You can be happy about the dub but it's a stolen dub. And are you saying you'd argue if my name was different? Seems like you're arguing anyway.
	Isaac Nezz here ya go
	Karen, your turn to admit it was an L, move on.
	Los Alibis a wrong loss
	Karen, lol, and still counts as a loss. got anything else?
	Los Alibis no. It's a loss, never denied that. Just a frustrating, stolen game.
	Karen, every loss is frustrating, for different reasons.
	Karen Rose They didn't miss anything, time ran out no foul.
	Edgar Fortune wrong. From the media last night and on  nba radio today
	Karen Rose no foul, no call. Ticky tack, you’re wrong. No foul, Lakers win.
	Edgar Fortune huh??This isn't about the Lakers game.
LAC	Good for the heat
LAC	The claw
LAC	👍👍
LAC	The refs gave them the game, it was awful
PHI	😭stop always trynna blame the reff
	Isaac Nezz i watched them hand the clippers the game in the 4th quarter… it’s sad that game was even remotely close the sixers have 2 starters healthy… and the refs also said after the game after reviewing the play they should have called a foul on the final play of the game because oubre was fouled.
PHI	they admitted they fuked up but I’m blaming the refs lol
	Isaac, sssh, it’s ok. let the guy believe that, might help take the sting off a little.
	Brett Wright y’all always say refs instead of believing these games are fake
	Ty'ran Ross sports betting rules sports it’s all fake
PHI	Refs were awful in this game
PHI	🤣🤣🤣🤣😪
LAC	👍
LAC	the referee leads the clippers to a win, the game is soft and not attractive anymore
LAC	Kawhi took over the game in the 4th
	John Brown the refs took over
LAC	Kawhi the Klaw strikes again!!!

	Emzjul Pareja sge magkita2 tayu sa playoffs Ano team mo Lakers??? Sweep Rana clippers hahaha
	Mary Ellen Estrosas di ako Lakers.. kung saan ang winning team, don ako
LAC	This dude is one of the most absolutely overrated players in the history of the game.
LAC	Pretty sad to struggle against the sixers without Embiid. They’re pretty bad
LAC	You mean the refs came out in the end to help the clips win? Okay. I fixed the headline for ya.
PHI	With a little over a minute left, Tyrese Maxey pretty much gave the game away when he tripped and fell over his own feet with the Sixers up three. I’d pinpoint that as the moment the Sixers gave this one away.
	Yeah fake news home slice! More like refs rigged the game and made sure no fouls were called against Kawhi because they had money on the clips! NBA the game that I once loved has turned into the WWE. Refs control the games that’s how gambling works
	A obvious blocking foul at the end of the game with the player in the restricted area but refs with the no call
PHI	Sixers got robbed
	Omod, right, that always happens. they should finish 82-0 if not for those refs.
	Omod Galli why because they lost ? Ha ha I tell you common
	Game saving foul more like
PHI	Refs strikes again basketball fake
LAC	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	Ima really fun guy...
	Ulol grabe pandaraya ng mga ref
	Grabeh laki ng tambak ng clippers ah🤣🤣🤣108-10776🤣🤣🤣

LAC	KLAW***
	With some help from the refs!!! Some bs calls and none calls!
	Bryan Order how about the of coffee from maxi no contact?
	Junre Tragura Jadol they reviewed that play lol
	Bryan Order who reviewed? The ref?
	Junre Tragura Jadol clippers challenged the foul call and it wasnt a foul... so no wrong call... refs admitted after the game they missed the call on the last play of the game
	🤷 thats your story
PHI	Without embid..
LAC	Solid block😁😁😁
	Bhh
