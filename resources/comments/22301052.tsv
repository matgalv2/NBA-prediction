	No one but the refs won the game. They even admitted they missed the KO call to end the game. 😡
	So inspiring. A team with 4 superstars won 1 point against a team without their superstar.
	Good for the heat
	The claw
	The refs gave them the game, it was awful
	 you obviously didn’t watch the game !!!!We (clippers) had more fouls and misses than the 6ixers they just couldn’t finish strong 😭stop always trynna blame the reff
	 y’all always say refs instead of believing these games are fake
	Refs were awful in this game
	Kawhi took over the game in the 4th
	the referee leads the clippers to a win, the game is soft and not attractive anymore
	Kawhi the Klaw strikes again!!!
	The klaw ✋🏿

	The referees must be the MVP..

	Congrats my team clippers 2024 NBA champion finalmvp king kawhi mark my words 💪🏾🏆🔥
	This dude is one of the most absolutely overrated players in the history of the game.
	Pretty sad to struggle against the sixers without Embiid. They’re pretty bad
	You mean the refs came out in the end to help the clips win? Okay. I fixed the headline for ya.
	With a little over a minute left, Tyrese Maxey pretty much gave the game away when he tripped and fell over his own feet with the Sixers up three. I’d pinpoint that as the moment the Sixers gave this one away.
	Yeah fake news home slice! More like refs rigged the game and made sure no fouls were called against Kawhi because they had money on the clips! NBA the game that I once loved has turned into the WWE. Refs control the games that’s how gambling works
	A obvious blocking foul at the end of the game with the player in the restricted area but refs with the no call
	Sixers got robbed
	Game saving foul more like
	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	LA flippers
	GSW vs Magic - Game fixing Failed..
