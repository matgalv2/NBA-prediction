TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
NYK	LMFAO they owed us one from that Houston game....thanks NBA!!!!!!
	Kouyate Moussa right!!! I said the same thing.
NYK	Jalen Brunson should be in the mvp race, with sga kawhi or luka. Greatest predic knicks will make it to east finals vs milwaukee.
	Ian Austria MVP race lol? Joker already has that shit in the bag.
	Ian Austria if anything most improved award
	Ian Austria neither of those teams is getting past Boston.
	Ian Austria wake up. Heat and Knicks fans are equally delusional 😂🗑️
NYK	Knicks need to get healthy... Jalen playing hard, but his turnovers are from him trying to do to much.. Can't win games by yourself
	Rahn Garland indeed, last night he lost a lot of balls while dribbling it. Even Fournier was able to poke 1 or 2 away from him...
	honestly if league called things right brunson would get called for offensive foul a lot more.  
	Jeremy Fackrell they 100 percent do this already lol when a hand touch is a foul nowadays they definitely practice for fouls
	Bad call, refs. As usual NBA refs mucked another game. Outcome may have been the same but call it like you should. No one can complain about refs and there is nothing done to them when they make bad calls. 🤬
NYK	The Knicks have so many injuries but are still playing well. It’s fun again.
DET	It so obv we need og back badly.  Our success is clearly dependent on him and what he brings defensively
	They tackled a player and get no foul.
	The ref's won this game 😆 the nba needs to investigate both referees for that abysmal call no foul in the closing minutes against Detroit..
	79 points from the nova players
	The refs decided this game. Lol.
	Is the NBA trying to help the Knicks get into the NBA finals 🙈
	Liked Brunson but it was clear that refs did extra work tonight for the Knicks!
	8vs 5 should the knicks surrender their win to detroit.
NYK	Classic New York mugging!
NYK	Congratulations 🎉 knicks
	Detroit vs new york ref...aha
NYK	We needed this win after the terrible Showing in Boston ￼last Saturday￼
	thank you ref for the win 😁
	NBA games is going gonna worst lmao HAHAHAHA
	the referee is biased. That would have been OT.
DET	here again, it's Pistons 😂
	"Jalen ""Charles"" Brunson"
DET	Relax it's the Pistons lol
NYK	Let’s go New York Knicks
NYK	Brunson is the best Knick since Ewing…Knicks should’ve blown these bums out
NYK	He is way better than Luka. You done messed up Dallas.
DET	What a horrible job the refs did. Ruined another team’s effort with one of the worst non calls. With the league not taking a position, you lessen your product. Your social policies, taking defense away with rule changes have ruined a great game. I realize this is to far gone, and will never be genuine again. Congrats🖕🏼
NYK	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
NYK	Good luck
DET	Nearly lost at the hands of the 2 we gave to Detroit  Grimes and Flynn. Grimes picked Brunsons pockets twice and rained down 3s and nearly won for Detroit. Flynn slicing his way to the hole and poppin 3s, and look what we got for them......
NYK	Beating an 8 win team…. I guess we should give this dude the mvp right lol
	Tackle football at the end of this one pistons suck bad but the no call they have a case now
	must be nice to get foul calls 😆
SPAM	Jeremy Fackrell https://t.me/+IiPSD_qvMyUyYzM8
NYK	The knicks tackle better than the giants
NYK	I wonder if the Knicks is going to be putting in a protest on this one 😆😆😆🏀
NYK	Great game Brunson - horrible tackle no call…
	A nail biter over a team that's won 14% of its games. Such a performance does not qualify as one suggesting championship timber.
DET	I'm no pistons fan but this ridiculous. On a national TV at the last play, divicenzo suddenly played like a lineman and those Adam silver's zebras didn't whistle it because there is money involved. On their minds this is just pistons so who cares.
	Leo Brazil Knicks favored by 11+ pts and the Over/Under was still under even if Hart made the final free throw, so not much changed because of the final 30 seconds other than those who bet the Money line. So no 😕
	Nueva York Knicks jugándole un juego tan serrao a Detroit eso algo raro lo que pasó que Detroit tiro mucho mejor detra de aro tuvo mejor gol de campo y Bruson que todo los días eh un muchacho que juega en serio vale la pena ve ese muchacho jugando baloncesto la entrega de ese muchacho se ve que no está en chiste jugando baloncesto está entre lo 3 mejores point guard armadores que má anota con ese 27.7 puntos por partido pero su entrega y su Vania lo tiene como el mejor point guard anotador de la Coferencia Este y este equipo eh 9 en eficiencia defensiva mejorando esa defensa y ofesiva la deficiencia son entre lo 7 mejores obligao que ellos tenga ese tercer mejor récord de la conferencia con 35-23 jugando pa 603 un equipo con baja su proporción por rebote ofesivo eh el segundo mejor y eh un equipo que permite poco puntos estos Knicks New York Knicks eh el 3 equipo que menos permite puntos está Season temporada
	The NBA: The biggest joke out of all the major sports leagues.. 🤡 show!
	That was a foul on Thompson my God ref
	NBA cares. Where amazing happens. 🤡
DET	Worst call of the season the pistons got robbed that  ref was blind😑😑
NYK	Congratulations💯💯💯
	Bad call at the end of the game. It’s got to be tough for Pistons fans.
	This game should have been Detroit's win!!!!
	Red man.  Son putting up numbers !!
NYK	Bad hair style u look like a predator
	Thank you refs
DET	Detroit Pistons got screwed!!!🏀
NYK	Great Game, Free Win 😂😂 💪💨💯🎯 Refs 🗑
	Edwin Fontanez that was a close one
	Mookavelli Gardesaniwild ending
	Kawawang Detroit, nakakahiya daw pag natalo nicks sa hc. 🤣
	Knicks lucky Detroit didn't have bogdonavic.
	Jason Hunt because bogdonavic is a Knick 😂
