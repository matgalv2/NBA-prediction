TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	the #kings bounced back with a win!!! the trio of fox, sabonis and barnes (combined for 70  pts), is enough to grab the W, and send the #nuggets to their 3rd straight defeats heading to ASG break!!! congrats 🙂
	If Nuggets don’t win at least 58 games Jokic will not win MVP
	Yarc Lewinson shai much deserved
	De'Aaron Fox
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling.
	Kings for the win 💯
	Nuggets tanking just when the King's needs to lose so the Lakers can climb up 😅
	Those are Filipino Kai Sotto numbers 💯 They also are both left handed 🔥💯 In other words, Kai Sotto of the Philippines is the asian version of Domantas Sabonis 😎 Therefore,  Kai Sotto can help any NBA teams like the Detroit Pistons win the championship this year 🔥
	John Lester Tayros agree
	John Lester Tayros you guys are so delusion. 😂

	Fox and Sabonis not being selected as all-stars is bad look for the NBA.
	As a fan of nuggets, the worse loss this season by far
