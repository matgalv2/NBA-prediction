	Chicago Bulls Vs Orlando Magic
CHI	Bulls should have won that game last night.
ORL	Nathan D Smith the refs had Orlando jerseys on under their shirts.  I'm almost to the point of not watching games at all anymore. They should have press conferences with the refs after every game in all sports , complete transparency, The NBA has become a travesty.
ORL	Petey Thomas LMAO, there were at least 3 phantom calls on Orlando last night. They were bad but it wasn’t one sighted by any means. Go Magic
	Shawn Wolters I looked at your pictures, since you are a white dude who can dress ummu let that slide 🛝 😉.  The refs had Magic jerseys under their shirts quit playin! They probably live around the corner.

	Nba really ought to watch these games this year for officiating. Officiating last night was was horrible and the main reason Orlando won besides the fact they played dirty ball
	Bill Clark I agree , the calls were very one sided.

CHI	Bulls could of drafted him and had a better player than Vuc and kept their draft picks.
	Kurt Brill I told everyone when it happened we were giving up too much and people told me I was crazy that I didn’t know what I was taking about.  Could have WCJ and Wagner right now.
	Eric Freeman WCJ😂

CHI	They couldn’t stop this guy! DeRozan trying to be the “hero” again, and making bad choices down the stretch along with bad coaching from Billy Donovan, and terrible officiating led to this Bulls loss!
