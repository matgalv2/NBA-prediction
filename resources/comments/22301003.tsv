	plus 1 good defense to Leonard
	This guy was a scoring machine 30points easy. Now he does assist like he is the assistant ..
	As always slow start in 1st half, struggle comes first,but showed up the D for the entire games!basketball is all about defense!win it!love it!
	Wow nice play all clippers healthy
	Best defensive player of the year 🔥
	It be ya own teammates 😂😂😂
	Bro would’ve had 15 if he didn’t try and block kawhi after passing it to him😂. It look like me in a pick up game when I’m not getting the ball enough (everyone gets gaurded)😂
	Here...LeBron James_ Impact of Experience on Success
	“I don’t play defense often… but when I do, its against my own teammates. Stay thirsty my friends”
	Impressive win against a Championship caliber team…..
	He could have had a block on that stat line had he played better D on Kawhi
	Harden should do a jersey swap with Gradey
	That should have been 15asst if he didn't try to block the shot of Kawhi😂🤪
	Well is the draymond green highlight being a dirty player knocking over a coach and no real penalty. How many times long does he have to be a dirty player for a real penalty to happen
	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	Where is Westbrook these days???
	It's all surviving per game
	James Harden been quiet
	Almost had 13 assist and 1 block lol
	❤️❤️
	
	 Kpaaaa
	
	And good defense on his own team. What a clown 🤡
	man nba loves to promote this guy
	Best team in the league! No up for debate.
	They continue beating the subpar teams, and they continue having a very hard time with the good teams. Will this trend continue and if so will they be able to find some magical recipe for getting past the first or second round of the playoffs?
	Congratulations
	I did not remember he got 19 today, I only remembered he “defended” Kawhi well
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Portland Trail Blazers
	Man tired of this nigha, every night can look like this or better but he lost that Rocket harden 🤦🏾
	What happened to the Blazers
	Naw were the video of that contested shot
	How do people celebrate holidays that are influenced by specific weather conditions?
	These high ass scores just mean no defense
	His defense seems to be getting better
	To beat a 19 and 50 team, ha ha!
	He loves balling when no one’s watching!!!
	
	Clippers in Playoffs form. They run LA😤😤😤
	Nice play 😊🏀❤️
	❤
	HARDEN AND WESTBROOK ARE MORE VALUABLE TO THE CLIPPERS THEN PG AND KAWHI
	What else to do ? Fear the beard !
	Matthew 10:41
	5 grands for the first 5 people to hit me up with God is Good
	"I'm Giving 5 Bands to the first 7 to hit me up now with ""STRIVING"" cus I feel people still going as through HARD TIMES this moment , remain blessed y'all"
	I'ma do this once sending 5 grands to the first
	
	Things are kinda tough atm especially this time of the year so l'm gifting 8 grands to the first 10 people to message me with 🏦
	Such a shame for us Blazers that we keep on losing
	I'd be sick that beard by now
	Plus 1 potential block to Kawhi Leonard 😅
	James Harden
	Great Defense on Kawhi
	Go Clips...
	The Beardman🧔King 👑
	And 1 DEFENSIVE MVP play!
