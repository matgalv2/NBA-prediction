TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	plus 1 good defense to Leonard
LAC	This guy was a scoring machine 30points easy. Now he does assist like he is the assistant ..
LAC	As always slow start in 1st half, struggle comes first,but showed up the D for the entire games!basketball is all about defense!win it!love it!
LAC	Wow nice play all clippers healthy
LAC	Best defensive player of the year 🔥
LAC	It be ya own teammates 😂😂😂
LAC	Bro would’ve had 15 if he didn’t try and block kawhi after passing it to him😂. It look like me in a pick up game when I’m not getting the ball enough (everyone gets gaurded)😂
	Here...LeBron James_ Impact of Experience on Success
LAC	“I don’t play defense often… but when I do, its against my own teammates. Stay thirsty my friends”
	Impressive win against a Championship caliber team…..
LAC	Harden should do a jersey swap with Gradey
LAC	He could have had a block on that stat line had he played better D on Kawhi
LAC	That should have been 15asst if he didn't try to block the shot of Kawhi😂🤪
	Well is the draymond green highlight being a dirty player knocking over a coach and no real penalty. How many times long does he have to be a dirty player for a real penalty to happen
LAC	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	It's all surviving per game
LAC	James Harden been quiet
LAC	Where is Westbrook these days???
	Almost had 13 assist and 1 block lol
	❤️❤️
	Dorgeles Nomel
	Kolja Becker
LAC	And good defense on his own team. What a clown 🤡
LAC	man nba loves to promote this guy
LAC	They continue beating the subpar teams, and they continue having a very hard time with the good teams. Will this trend continue and if so will they be able to find some magical recipe for getting past the first or second round of the playoffs?
LAC	Best team in the league! No up for debate.
LAC	Congratulations
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Portland Trail Blazers
LAC	I did not remember he got 19 today, I only remembered he “defended” Kawhi well
LAC	Man tired of this nigha, every night can look like this or better but he lost that Rocket harden 🤦🏾
POR	What happened to the Blazers
	Naw were the video of that contested shot
LAC	His defense seems to be getting better
	These high ass scores just mean no defense

	How do people celebrate holidays that are influenced by specific weather conditions?
LAC	To beat a 19 and 50 team, ha ha!
LAC	Clippers in Playoffs form. They run LA😤😤😤
LAC	He loves balling when no one’s watching!!!
LAC	Nice play 😊🏀❤️
LAC	❤
LAC	HARDEN AND WESTBROOK ARE MORE VALUABLE TO THE CLIPPERS THEN PG AND KAWHI
	Matthew 10:41
LAC	What else to do ? Fear the beard !
	5 grands for the first 5 people to hit me up with God is Good
	"I'm Giving 5 Bands to the first 7 to hit me up now with ""STRIVING"" cus I feel people still going as through HARD TIMES this moment , remain blessed y'all"
	I'ma do this once sending 5 grands to the first

	"Things are kinda tough atm especially this time of the year so l'm gifting 8 grands to the first 10 people to message me with ""TOUGH"" let's spread love and end inhumanity.❤️🏦"
POR	Such a shame for us Blazers that we keep on losing
	I'd be sick that beard by now
