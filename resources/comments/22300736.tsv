DAL	3rd straight wins for the #mavs!!! another double double for luka 🙂 #lukamagic
DAL	Mavs can't beat the Lakers when LeBron is healthy
	Kenneth Solomon don't bring up the kingflopper on the conversation
	Kenneth Solomon they can’t
	Kenneth Solomon L
DAL	That's why he is an All Star Starting 5
DAL	Really good player!!!
DAL	Knicks  fan but I love Luka. Knew it was going to be hard to beat him! He’s great!
DAL	Luka Doncic
DAL	#Luka💕
DAL	The mavs had to struggle with new York with 7 players 4 starters out. Cause for concern in Dallas
DAL	Fluke win the Mavs stink
SPAM	Liridon Shehu Wow I love your nice comment👍😍add me as Facebook friends  VIEW MY PROFILE AND HIT ADD FRIEND
DAL	I watched the game last night and this dude is the master of making it look like he’s being fouled. So many non contact fouls
	Matt Greenleaf he shot 7 fts… lol are you sure you watched?
	We played with almost every starter not playing.... means nothing.
	RJ Joseph DiVincenzo and Hartenstein played 😏
	Abdulrazak Hassan Hartenstein played only the first half..got injuried ..Brunson..Randle .Anunoby...Robinson....all out ...plus they had a 7 man rotation because of the trade.
	RJ Joseph w is w..
	RJ Joseph these Mavs have been injured all season. Stop the excuses.
	JJ Parks Excuses....?.... our two All Stars are out and 2 other Starters... cmon .. get a clue ...ps ... the Mav's aren't winning anything... who is out ... the back up to the back up point guard.... we had 7 guys total on the bench because of the trade... full team we are blowing your team our ...luka hogs the ball the entire game....I wouldn't want to play with him...
	RJ Joseph What happened Jan 11th??? What’s your excuse then?
	JJ Parks The Knicks are a different team today...Im not sure about the Knicks not winning...yet I do know the Mavs arent winning with Luka hogging the ball..PS..if it is only for fun why did you take offense to me saying the Knicks had 4 starters missi… Wyświetl więcej
	RJ Joseph what happened on Jan 11 not even a month ago with your starters. Answer the question
	RJ Joseph I didnt take offense. I just simply stated the fact that Mavs have been injured too even when they beat knicks on Jan 11. The Knicks and Mavs do not have a winning roster at all.
	RJ Joseph and? Your healthy team lost last game without luka lively exum kleber so wdym?
	RJ Joseph win
	Attention.... Knicks had 7 total players in uniform
DAL	I think we need to do two things right now.
	George Mwenya Shaun how can he still be no.5 in mvp race really ?
	Marko Muzelj Embiid won sorely for 1. His scoring 2. Carrying the team

DAL	He win because Jalen Brunson and Julie’s Randle don’t play for the knicks . For me is a normal player that scores without defence .. when the playoffs comes you see be is not a star player

	George Tolik- congratulations for 1st price for most stupid comment of the day. 😉
