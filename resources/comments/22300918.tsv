	 what a shame
	Who cares , He's a woman beater, a punk, this is the dude Barkley was talking about not letting back in the league, and since he's been back, violated a restraining order. Really NBA, This is the POSWB, but keep hoping folks forget
	how are you doing...?
	 I'm good, how are you
	Iâ€™m well..., can you please send me friend request if you donâ€™t mind...?
	Matthew Castano trigger harder, lil fasciboy! He served his suspension and all that you claim he did since back in the league, the courts say he didn't do. People get second chances. Deal with it!
	Wife beater
