TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	the #pacers bounced back, sending the #raptors to their 3rd straight defeats!!! siakam played well against his former team . 🙂
	Pascal Siakam
	Great Win Pacers..👏👏
	Mary Stonecipher can I be a friend
	Mary Stonecipher Looking beautiful.
	I wouldn't quite say he propelled the Pacers to victory. Siakam has always been a good player but he's better as a 3rd certainly not a 1st option
	Will Clarke he’s definitely an option 1 guy. The guy gets doubled every time he has the ball which opens up lanes for us. Hes got spots on the floor that are money every shot. Hes not a 30 point a Night guy but he’s a proven winner and I think he can honestly average 25 points a game because his shooting percentage is so high. He shoots like 60% from the floor. Just my opinion
	Jason Quick and that's your right lol but look at the team roster he had last year... was good enough for maybe at least a round one exit but siakam barely got the team to the 9th or 10th and then lost that game. For the first part of this year it was … Wyświetl więcej
	Will Clarke you mean the g league players that he was playing  with except,  scotte  and og
	Lenno G Len acuiwa poeltl Trent vanvleet
	Sorry but your team will now be forced to overpay him
	Just couldn’t cover the -2.5 could ya!
	Is he the 'i am the captain now' guy? Oh he play ball? Nice
	Paskal is now the best player of the Pacers.
	grear win pacers
	Always awesome to watch Pascal. Such a team player too.
	un lion reste un lion 💪💪 champion 🙏
	Pascal is a good player my brother 💪🇨🇲🇨🇲
	🌶️⭐👏
	My favorite player Siakam
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	Raptors couldn’t hit a three and it slipped away. Same old story, even with the trades.
	Kent Chambers 
	Indiana Pacers Vs Toronto Raptors
	Had to be tough to play against a team you gave your all to. But he had to show them what they would be missing. Go Indiana Pacers
	Swirling bad luck doesn’t work where he came from
	Raptors should practice free throws for a couple days straight 
	DONT U DARE take away a block from victor.. fanduel needs to have to pay out this boost
	Pascal led the charge.
	Yall couldn’t have picked a better graphic for him? Haha
	Aeron Soriano 
	Congratulations
	Before, everyone wanted him gone (not me)... now, everyone misses him. Smh.
	Spicy P balling
	Boom.          Baby. !!
	Look at me. I'm the captain now!
	A face only his momma could love
	Low scoring
	Wael Alkhoury

	Why is Isiah Stewart in the nba ? What a look for the league 😂
	I know people that do more work for the city of Indianapolis and they don’t make millions
