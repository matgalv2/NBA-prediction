TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	Nice well rounded stats.
LAC	Great job Kawhi!!
LAC	The Best Team
LAC	Musa Ireno Same narrative every year. Everyone picks them as the best team in reg. season, But come playoffs? haha. They never fail to choke year in and year out. Also they’ve been choking for the past 53 years(The only team in NBA without a finals appearance). Straight garbage of a franchise.
LAC	Best team
LAC	#ClipperNation #BounceBack thanks to kawhi's 100% healthy in that game😎👌
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Memphis Grizzlies
LAC	Terrible win
LAC	Kawhi Leonard
	Nobody jokes about this win. And everyone joking about Lakers win over SA.
	Mr Efficient, 9/12 vs OKC, 10/18 vs Memphis.
	Don't be afraid of failure; be afraid of petty success.
LAC	The klaw ✋🏿
MEM	Memphis Ain't A Great Win But We'll Take It
	We beat OKC next time.That is a promise
	This game busted up my 10 game parlay.  Picked one too many underdogs

	Nice..beating the topseeder is such only a great honor..
	It's not going to help if we don't have a coach. The team don't have any chemistry and Paul George needs to go.
LAC	Same narrative every year. Everyone picks them as the best team in reg. season, But come playoffs? haha. They never fail to choke year in and year out. Also they’ve been choking for the past 53 years(The only team in NBA without a finals appearance). Straight garbage of a franchise.
LAC	Just imagine if Kawhi was out🙈
LAC	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
LAC	Looks like a good WIN!!!

	Kawhi je vous supporte cette saison, vous pouvez le faire comme le joker l'a fait l'an dernier. Que le Seigneur vous préserve et vous guide jusqu'à la victoire finale. Go Harden, Go Westbrook, Go Paul George, Go Zubac, Go Clippers for the win 🙏🏾 !
