TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Nice well rounded stats.
	Great job Kawhi!!
	The Best Team
	Musa Ireno Same narrative every year. Everyone picks them as the best team in reg. season, But come playoffs? haha. They never fail to choke year in and year out. Also they’ve been choking for the past 53 years(The only team in NBA without a finals appearance). Straight garbage of a franchise.
	Best team
	#ClipperNation #BounceBack thanks to kawhi's 100% healthy in that game😎👌
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Memphis Grizzlies
	Terrible win
	Kawhi Leonard
	Nobody jokes about this win. And everyone joking about Lakers win over SA.
	Mr Efficient, 9/12 vs OKC, 10/18 vs Memphis.
	Don't be afraid of failure; be afraid of petty success.
	The klaw ✋🏿
	Memphis Ain't A Great Win But We'll Take It
	We beat OKC next time.That is a promise
	This game busted up my 10 game parlay.  Picked one too many underdogs

	Muntikan pa idol Kala ko matatalo kayo..hehe
	Nice..beating the topseeder is such only a great honor..
	It's not going to help if we don't have a coach. The team don't have any chemistry and Paul George needs to go.
	Same narrative every year. Everyone picks them as the best team in reg. season, But come playoffs? haha. They never fail to choke year in and year out. Also they’ve been choking for the past 53 years(The only team in NBA without a finals appearance). Straight garbage of a franchise.
	Just imagine if Kawhi was out🙈 
	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	Looks like a good WIN!!!
	Great!
	In love❤️💙💪🏾🏀
	Kawhi je vous supporte cette saison, vous pouvez le faire comme le joker l'a fait l'an dernier. Que le Seigneur vous préserve et vous guide jusqu'à la victoire finale. Go Harden, Go Westbrook, Go Paul George, Go Zubac, Go Clippers for the win 🙏🏾 !

	High school 🥰🥰🥰
	Wemby is the next GOAT! Kawhi will pass him the torch after Kawhi gets his 8 ring in the next 10 years with Clippers!💙❤️ 😤🔥🏀
