	The most disrespected #1 pick. Everyone but a magic fan wanted him to be bust. It's really made clear. Less than a handful of NBA players have done what he has done at his age.

	Jaxon Bearskin as a true fan of the Magic since 02 I can’t agree with you more. I was actually happy we took him first overall. I knew he was gonna be something special. ORLANDO MAGIC WOOOOOOO OOOOOOO.

	ppl can laugh and wish bad on this kid. But as soon as we drafted him almost 2 years ago I knew he was gonna be something special. We might not be title contenders yet but within a few years we’ll be one of the best teams in the league for years to come. Oh and kid made the all star at 21 🤯
	Tyler Christy , you never know.   Orlando could be a dark horse in the playoffs.   People before the season began were questioning if they could even make the play in and now they are currently 3rd seed and one game back from second seed.
	3rd Seed… 1 game back from 2nd… 👀 #GoMagic
	And 3rd seed in the East.
	50 wins in reach!!
	Great coaching and great play from P5 and the role players
