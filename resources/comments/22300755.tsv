	Kenneth Solomon
IND	Kenneth Solomon Indians is a baseball team so yea they would demolish them
NYK	An amazing show!!! Without OG, RANDLE, Robinson! Sims! 40 year old Gibson at center :)) amazing!!
	Austin Flynn Woodin and no hartenstein
	Austin Flynn Woodin “EXACTLY‼️”
	Austin Flynn Woodin that’s cute, yall barely beat us last time by like 4 when you had all them guys playing &amp; we had a few guys out 
	Nick Mercado they only played 3 times. First time was in indy and indy won. Then it was like a week ago and none of those guys played in that game.
	Nick Mercado What are you trying to say exactly... that the Pacers are the better team? The Knicks have the better record and that's even with most of their prominent players out injured for quite some time.
	Nick Mercado again without Og, Mitchell Robinson, Randle,  iq and rj traded so no bojan and Burks as well… whatever makes you sleep better
	Austin Flynn Woodin  FACTS …Health is key
	Austin Flynn Woodin don’t bother trying to explain logic to pacer fans 😂
	Joseph Ortiz that’s logic? As I said before, is your plan to use that “logic” every time you lose for the rest of the season? Availability is the best ability. Not surprised though, it’s New York.
	Austin Flynn Woodin So you plan on saying this every game for the rest of the season? Sounds about New York. Availability is the best ability.
	Austin Flynn Woodin .. Your filters are cringe af

	This brother will bring Indiana a championship
	OG plays, the score line flips the other way
	Good win Indy. Those are the games you’re supposed to win. We’ll meet again.
	All you haters who comment without even having watched the game, Hali at one point threw himself a pass off the backboard and then mid air dished it to Siakam for a three pointer. If you don’t think that’s “putting on a show” than you are crazy.
	Indiana Pacers Vs New York Knicks
	The Bucks team owner stuffing the stat sheet   
IND	According to a paper I read, Indiana is the Spanish word for indigenous.
NYK	Put on A show ,  lol,Knicks didn't even have half their starting line up , ha ha.Took pacers about 4 loses to get Pascal inclimated , see you down the road ..
IND	Good win Indy. Those are the games you’re supposed to win. We’ll meet again.
	Todd Pringle this version of the Knicks even with Brunson is a lottery team. They need those 3 guys back.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović vratio se Haliburton i Pacersi dobili najdražeg protivnika..
	Poor Brunson did all he could to try &amp; get the W over the boyz but he was a 1 man band pretty much
IND	Hali god is back.
