CHI	Coby
CHI	Ricky Warren to me f*ck lonzo we don’t need him….both BALL brothers are TRASH and injury prone you ask me
CHI	Ricky Warren yeah, it’s time to cut our losses and build around our players that’s been putting in the work.
	Ricky Warren https://neglectsquad.com/kbzvtp2mvm...
CHI	Ricky Warren I mean yeah but still hope Lonzo comes back healthy regardless
SAC	And nobody beats a team being down 20 without the referee's help I'm sorry you can't beat the Sacramento Kings without the referees
SAC	These Kings probably are the most perplexing team in the NBA now
CHI	Christer Carandang They used to be good!
CHI	Derozan with 19 in the 4th !! Free Zach and build this team !!!
SAC	Jason Yeezy Lewis The King in the fourth is back!
CHI	Dude is pretty good. His value is going up and up
CHI	Awesome game. What a comeback.
CHI	Not counting us out yet but imagine this team next year if everyone returns and we have Zach and Lonzo if everyone wants to play for a ring this team will be very deep I'd say Lonzo off the bench tho but he can get comeback player or 6th man of they year if he comes back good
CHI	Ephriam Graves Sorry bro but Zach has played his last game as a bull. He will be gone
CHI	Yeah most likely but gonna be hard to trade him with that surgery
CHI	He's probably gonna have to play to audition for teams interest
CHI	Knew this #3 pick was special. Can't wait to see more of him in future seasons
CHI	Marc Glince #7 pick
CHI	Sorry my mistake 🙂
CHI	Demar leadership at the fourth lead the bulls to victory
