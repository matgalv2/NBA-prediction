	🔥 
	Alex Werries if they trade him at this point, they will loose too many fans. Me included.
	He’s gotta be in the discussion for MIP
	He been ballin 🏀💯⭐ lately. Real good game
	Dude is becoming a legitimate star right before our eyes. CHI has some really nice pieces they can build around.
	Jay Smith https://neglectsquad.com/kbzvtp2mvm...
	DeRozan **33** points vs Kings was correct stat.

	Marco Afable hello how are you doing today am Rita and you
	Most improved player
	Good work bulls
	Ppl talking about they can’t wait until Lonzo come back. Mayne plz… Coby has been ballin. Put some respect on his name lol. He earned that pg position
	Coby
	Ricky Warren to me f*ck lonzo we don’t need him….both BALL brothers are TRASH and injury prone you ask me
	Ricky Warren yeah, it’s time to cut our losses and build around our players that’s been putting in the work.
	Ricky Warren https://neglectsquad.com/kbzvtp2mvm...
	Ricky Warren I mean yeah but still hope Lonzo comes back healthy regardless
	And nobody beats a team being down 20 without the referee's help I'm sorry you can't beat the Sacramento Kings without the referees
	These Kings probably are the most perplexing team in the NBA now
	Christer Carandang They used to be good!
	Derozan with 19 in the 4th !! Free Zach and build this team !!!
	Jason Yeezy Lewis The King in the fourth is back!
	Dude is pretty good. His value is going up and up
	Awesome game. What a comeback.
	Not counting us out yet but imagine this team next year if everyone returns and we have Zach and Lonzo if everyone wants to play for a ring this team will be very deep I'd say Lonzo off the bench tho but he can get comeback player or 6th man of they year if he comes back good
	Ephriam Graves Sorry bro but Zach has played his last game as a bull. He will be gone
	Yeah most likely but gonna be hard to trade him with that surgery
	He's probably gonna have to play to audition for teams interest
	Knew this #3 pick was special. Can't wait to see more of him in future seasons
	Marc Glince #7 pick
	Sorry my mistake 🙂
	Demar leadership at the fourth lead the bulls to victory
	From North Carolina 🔥🏀 #BullsNation
	Daniele Zinni Heel yeah, he is!! I love me some Coby!! Go Bulls and go Heels!!

	"Coby ""Shinobi"" White"
	You see why Sacramento is going no where…a smarter team gets a few stops in that 4th and wins by 25 easily
	LOVE IT

	Vooch is slowly turning into Zach Lavine!!!!

	You save my life, out of debt and I do not think I could ever tell you how much you mean to me, I will keep telling people about your good work in my life &amp; family, thank you.
	Let assume if $3,000 was deposited into your cash app or paypal as a blessing what will you use it for be honest (1) food (2) child (3) bills (4) family (5) car (6) investment (7) your needs (😎 rent (9) college (10) save it (11) vacation
	Keeping this to myself isn't a good idea: I decided to tell everyone so you guys can benefit from her.
	Literally was going to bet on the king's at home then I thought this team is so f****** up-and-down.
	Good win
