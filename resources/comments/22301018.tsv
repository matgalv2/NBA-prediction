TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Someone needs to hurt AD so the lakers lose. He's the only reason they win.
	I asked before the game, with the NBA doing everything they could to make sure LeBron gets in the playoffs, what the over/under was for how many more fouls the regs called against the 76ers and how many more free throws the Lakers shot?
	The best guy on the Lakers.  AD is rhe main driver of their success.
	LeBron james is the greatest player ever
	Yessss up up .nice play Lakers ..congrats to our Lakers team yahooooo❤️❤️❤️🏀💪💪🥂
	AD absolutely can dominate if the opponent doesn't have a Superstar big man
	I’m enjoying watching the Lakers scramble to get into a play in game. 😂
	Dante Giordano last year you also enjoyed it right all the way into the conference finals
	Lakers should make ad their go to guy. When healthy ( that’s the Asterix) he is without a doubt their best player.
	Lakers win &amp;  Warriors lose! ☺️
	😂😂😂
	LeBron s carrier
	AD’s dominant performance against the THIRD BEST CENTER (*in 76ers). He should’ve never moved to the 5.
	Big Man, Little Man, Invisible Man 😂 IDC, Just Win. Congratulations AD n Lakers, 4th Quarter Pull Up n Pull Off n Away we Went!
	If the Lakers stay healthy they will do well in the playoffs,   they need a little stronger bench
	I almost hate Maxey for a lifetime for taking that shot. Luckily it didn't count. My parlay is -4.5 and -6.5.🤦🤦🤦
	Oh yeah! Lakers win again! Let’s go get that 8th or even 7th seed! 🙌👏❤️👌👍
	Why is every performance called dominant? It is not against AD but with everybody. These sites have to use all these catch words to get attention. 23 points is not dominant. 19 rebounds is awesome but not dominant. Great night, not dominant. I am a Nugs fan and I don't like when they use dominant for Joker all the time either.
	Devin Marshall legendary performance lol
	AD dominate against Phily without Embiid. His fans think he is best Center and best defender haha. Against Jokic, Sabonis, Gobert, Embiid, he can’t play.
	its not a dominant performance..in fact he plays poor tonight with only mo bamba guarding him im not impress they almost loose this game..he needs to be better afterall they came from 3 days off,they lacked that energy.all of them
	LeBron james is the legend😎
	Don't forget LeBron's EIGHT TURNOVERS on that stat line...
	Funny how he didn't dominate in the first game against the sixers when they had a healthy Embiid playing
	If Joel was playing lakers would had lost and also 76ers was playing the refs to
	lebron james🔥🔥🔥🔥
	Ah, yes.....AD played an eazy big (or no big) in this one 😂😂
	Lets wait Howard, together with AD and bron. Lets rock and Roll lakers!
	Lets be real they struggled against an Embiidless 76ers team. Their season is gonna come down to winning a play in game. Dominant teams dont have to worry about that.
	Congrats Lakers, warriors lose Lakers wins 😂
	💛💜💛💜
	W/out embid sure win.. with embid.. Davis soft and useless.. sure loss the game
	Dominant win by Lakeshow!!!!
	Can you get some votes for MVP can't win it but can't you get some votes pushing respect on street clothes Davis?No doubt my mind.He should be defensive clear.Here no doubt
	His coming good at the right time, let's hope he can hold his body together. Love watching AD.
	LeBron is undoubtedly the King!
	All haters to the podium
	Haha AD dominate the games against the g league player. How cute was that.
	Netoy Loft
	Not a good win but a win is still a win... Congratulations Lakers...
	Alright!! Let's go AD!!💪💪 Lakers win 💪💪
	Easy to dominate when the other teams centre isn’t playing
	Robert Biscuits Hart especially when that centre is reigning MVP.
	Congratulations 🎉🎉👏👏👏 Let's go lakers  ,❤️ to win , and next game to win against Pacers
	Lakers win GSW LOOSE wat a day
	Congratulations LA Lakers
	Congrats Lakers💜💛💪🏻
	lakers is back
	AD always ballin when the opponent has no quality big man.
	Good win for the Lakers. Bad loss for the Warriors. 
	Lakers win 
	Congrats team💜💛
	Gsw lost???
	this what i call a player
	LeBron James almost had a triple double
	Keep winning purple and gold 💪🔥
	lakers spot at #8 if remaining games will win all💪💪💪
	Lebron the steroids king
	Didn’t the refs push the lakers over the top with more FTs? My bad that’s a normal game for them
	AD leading his team
	Shane Friedrich to the 9th seed . Amazing
	Mamali Jamshidi yes it is
	It was painful to watch the lakers
	When AD shows up the Lakers win. That centre position is crucial in Lakers game.
	No Embiid, No Problem for the Lakers!
	Eugene De Vera, they still struggled, especially due to LeBron and his 8 turnovers
	lol Anthony Davis can only play defense on cans. If it’s a top big man, like Embid or jokic or Gianis, it’s BBQ chicken.
	Lakers is a hollywood team which is why they are getting more spotligjht than the top teams in the nba.... That is just pathetic...
	don't forget what the lakers did last year, coming from the play in fighting even reaching conference finals, don't sleep on them
	Lmk what good big was there to guard him he wouldnt have did that on embid
	76ers are irrelevant without The Process. Harden really makes a difference
	Glad I cashed out of my 5 legger.  Last leg was Lakers -7.5.  Whew.
	I am seeing Lakers Vs Nuggets in the Finals.
	Naw dawg do this for 2 series of the playoffs and we will speak ur name
	❤️💜💛💪
	My favorite team is whoever is playing the Lakers, coming from a JAZZ fan 😁 💯
	Lol they only can beat the Sixers when Embiid isn’t playing though. He’s dominated this matchup. 7-1 against Davis 😂
	what a great day   im gonna eat a chicken curry
	LeBron james is good boys 🏀🏀
	Keep on rolling Lakeshow
	I swear I thought he was on the injury list again glad to see him out there playing
	Yeah he can do that when he is not playing against big men!
	Congrats team Lakers
	yes congrats lakers hi Ad 👍👍👍
	GS Lose, lakers win! Yaahooooooo!
	Literally 😝
	🤣🤣🤣🤣 Philly sucks and so do the lakers
	Give them another participation mid season trophy! 🏆🏀🤣

	congrats  Lakers teams  good  jobs...
	Trade/Release LeBron
	Nice win Lakers. Yeah
	Great Job Captain 👍
	That's a bad number night for jokic 🤣
	THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING OUT THOSE
	Congratz AD &amp; Lakers Team ..!👍🏀💪💪💪🙏😮😊
	AD save the legacy of lebron
	Seems like a lot of promotion and carry on for a 9 seed beating an 8 seed.
	So who fear leflop....
	This guy is Ready to loose one more final series with James 💪💪💪💪💪💪
	Anthony Davis is one of the greats at NBA ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

	They're not coming out the west  if so money talks
	No Embiid ! Davis should dominate this is a no Brainer! Davis is like 2-16 against Embiid Joker Sabonis in the last 3 years! This was nothing burger 🍔!!

	Imagine if Embiid was healthy lakers would have lost
	James Rudy true, but that’s the nature of the beast. It’s a long season.
	The Flakers are just lucky that Embiid was not able play.
	Oh yeah! Lakers win again! Let’s go get that 8th or even 7th seed! 🙌👏❤️👌👍
	All this to lose in the first round to the Nuggets
	Wow! 19 Rebound!!!! 🔥
	King James is THE BEST
