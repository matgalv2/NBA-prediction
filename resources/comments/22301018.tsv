TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Someone needs to hurt AD so the lakers lose. He's the only reason they win.
	I asked before the game, with the NBA doing everything they could to make sure LeBron gets in the playoffs, what the over/under was for how many more fouls the regs called against the 76ers and how many more free throws the Lakers shot?
	The best guy on the Lakers.  AD is rhe main driver of their success.
	AD absolutely can dominate if the opponent doesn't have a Superstar big man
	LeBron james is the greatest player ever
	Yessss up up .nice play Lakers ..congrats to our Lakers team yahooooo❤️❤️❤️🏀💪💪🥂
	Lakers should make ad their go to guy. When healthy ( that’s the Asterix) he is without a doubt their best player.
	I’m enjoying watching the Lakers scramble to get into a play in game. 😂
	 last year you also enjoyed it right all the way into the conference finals
	 what do you get for making it to the conference finals? A participation trophy? With 2 of the biggest stars in the game? Congrats. Incredible feat. 😂
	 but you said u enjoyed seeing them fight for a play in spot lol but they beat out most of the teams that were in the playoffs until they ran into Denver who I think is about to win back to back championships and I am a lakers fan
	 heat always creep up in the playoffs cant count them out
	Lakers win &amp;  Warriors lose! ☺️
	 6-18 3pts. Dame kong tawa mga 3x Sidekick -SC30 baldog night night 😂😂😂
	AD’s dominant performance against the THIRD BEST CENTER (*in 76ers). He should’ve never moved to the 5.
	LeBron s carrier
	I almost hate Maxey for a lifetime for taking that shot. Luckily it didn't count. My parlay is -4.5 and -6.5.🤦🤦🤦
	If the Lakers stay healthy they will do well in the playoffs,   they need a little stronger bench
	Oh yeah! Lakers win again! Let’s go get that 8th or even 7th seed! 🙌👏❤️👌👍
	Big Man, Little Man, Invisible Man 😂 IDC, Just Win. Congratulations AD n Lakers, 4th Quarter Pull Up n Pull Off n Away we Went!
	"Why is every performance called dominant? It is not against AD but with everybody. These sites have to use all these catch words to get attention. 23 points is not dominant. 19 rebounds is awesome but not dominant. Great night, not dominant. I am a Nug… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 legendary performance lol
	AD dominate against Phily without Embiid. His fans think he is best Center and best defender haha. Against Jokic, Sabonis, Gobert, Embiid, he can’t play.
	its not a dominant performance..in fact he plays poor tonight with only mo bamba guarding him im not impress they almost loose this game..he needs to be better afterall they came from 3 days off,they lacked that energy.all of them
	Funny how he didn't dominate in the first game against the sixers when they had a healthy Embiid playing
	If Joel was playing lakers would had lost and also 76ers was playing the refs to
	Don't forget LeBron's EIGHT TURNOVERS on that stat line...
	LeBron james is the legend😎
	Lets be real they struggled against an Embiidless 76ers team. Their season is gonna come down to winning a play in game. Dominant teams dont have to worry about that.
	Ah, yes.....AD played an eazy big (or no big) in this one 😂😂
	Congrats Lakers, warriors lose Lakers wins 😂
	 lets go💛💜💛💜
	Dominant win by Lakeshow!!!!
	Lets wait Howard, together with AD and bron. Lets rock and Roll lakers!
	W/out embid sure win.. with embid.. Davis soft and useless.. sure loss the game
	His coming good at the right time, let's hope he can hold his body together. Love watching AD.
	lebron james🔥🔥🔥🔥
	Alright!! Let's go AD!!💪💪 Lakers win 💪💪
	Can you get some votes for MVP can't win it but can't you get some votes pushing respect on street clothes Davis?No doubt my mind.He should be defensive clear.Here no doubt
	Not a good win but a win is still a win... Congratulations Lakers...
	All haters to the podium
	Haha AD dominate the games against the g league player. How cute was that.
	
	Easy to dominate when the other teams centre isn’t playing
	LeBron is undoubtedly the King!
	Congratulations  Lakers 🎉🎉👏👏👏 Let's go lakers  ,❤️ to win , and next game to win against Pacers
	Lakers win GSW LOOSE wat a day
	Congratulations LA Lakers
	Congrats Lakers💜💛💪🏻
	lakers is back
	AD always ballin when the opponent has no quality big man.
	Lakers win 
	Good win for the Lakers. Bad loss for the Warriors. 
	Congrats team💜💛
	Gsw lost???
	this what i call a player
	LeBron James almost had a triple double
	Keep winning purple and gold 💪🔥
	lakers spot at #8 if remaining games will win all💪💪💪
	Lebron the steroids king
	Didn’t the refs push the lakers over the top with more FTs? My bad that’s a normal game for them
	AD leading his team
	 to the 9th seed . Amazing
	 yes it is
	It was painful to watch the lakers
	When AD shows up the Lakers win. That centre position is crucial in Lakers game.
	No Embiid, No Problem for the Lakers!
	lol Anthony Davis can only play defense on cans. If it’s a top big man, like Embid or jokic or Gianis, it’s BBQ chicken.
	Lakers is a hollywood team which is why they are getting more spotligjht than the top teams in the nba.... That is just pathetic...
	don't forget what the lakers did last year, coming from the play in fighting even reaching conference finals, don't sleep on them
	Lmk what good big was there to guard him he wouldnt have did that on embid
	76ers are irrelevant without The Process. Harden really makes a difference
	Glad I cashed out of my 5 legger.  Last leg was Lakers -7.5.  Whew.
	I am seeing Lakers Vs Nuggets in the Finals.
	Naw dawg do this for 2 series of the playoffs and we will speak ur name
	❤️💜💛💪
	My favorite team is whoever is playing the Lakers, coming from a JAZZ fan 😁 💯
	Lol they only can beat the Sixers when Embiid isn’t playing though. He’s dominated this matchup. 7-1 against Davis 😂
	what a great day   im gonna eat a chicken curry
	LeBron james is good boys 🏀🏀
	Keep on rolling Lakeshow
	I swear I thought he was on the injury list again glad to see him out there playing
	Yeah he can do that when he is not playing against big men!
	Congrats team Lakers
	yes congrats lakers hi Ad 👍👍👍
	GS Lose, lakers win! Yaahooooooo!
	Literally   &amp;  any time the Lakers win , they celebrating &amp; promoting LA like it’s the biggest achievement EVER esp. for a #9 seed 😝
	🤣🤣🤣🤣 Philly sucks and so do the lakers
	Give them another participation mid season trophy! 🏆🏀🤣
	76s hurt up

	Imagine if Embiid was healthy lakers would have lost
	 true, but that’s the nature of the beast. It’s a long season.
	The Flakers are just lucky that Embiid was not able play.
	Oh yeah! Lakers win again! Let’s go get that 8th or even 7th seed! 🙌👏❤️👌👍
