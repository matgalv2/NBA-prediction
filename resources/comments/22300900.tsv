OKC	Surely an error and that’s a 31 😂
	🤷‍♂️
POR	They played our deep bench and two starters. I would say the Blazers were more impressive.
OKC	Carolyn Dierking OKC is still tied for second best in the league.  They've consistently won games all season.  You don't need to insult them because Portland sucks.
OKC	Justin Brooke Portland played the Timberwolves the game before and almost beat them with their bench. Nobody is insulting OKC, I'm praising Portland for playing well against teams like that.
OKC	Carolyn Dierking ma’am. The Thunder just came off of a back to back against two playoff teams on the road and won one of them and then came to your house and beat you. When is the last time Portland did that? The team who won was more impressive
OKC	Neaven Justice The Thunder had to keep there starters in the entire game just to win.By 8. Portland played all their bench and 2 starters. And Jeremy Grant hardly played.  Right now Portland isn't looking for wins, we're looking for progress,  and they showed that.
OKC	Carolyn Dierking Most team’s goal is to win the game….
OKC	Carolyn Dierking that sounds good. But for a team that’s on the road coming off two hard back to back games… came in your house tired and fatigue and beat you. That’s what great teams do. Thunder played one of their worst games and still won by 8 lol meanwhile Portland shot lights out
OKC	Congratulations Thunder team and great Alexander performance
OKC	MVP all the way for Sha!!
