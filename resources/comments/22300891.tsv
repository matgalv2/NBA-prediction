	Made wemby look like that akward kid in gym class a few times, super skilled so back him down that low and footwork around time after time...once he gets serious about hitting 3-4 3s a game eme smartens up and sends dillon or Jalen green to 6th man...rockets were best early season when his assists were way up they have been way down recently they are better playing through him all game not Jalen  iso
	💯but he’s better than WEMBY💯 none of them can beat LIVELY💯
	Why europeans are taking over ??
	Beast down low
	Aslan parçası be.
	this guyvwas drafted by OKC.
	His effortless shooting prowess made the game seem deceptively simple.
	Pau Gasol 🤔
	Wemby’s husband
	Is that Wemby’s Daddy?
	Things are kinda tough atm especially this time of the year so l’m gifting 5 grands to the first 10 people to message me with “TOUGH” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.

	Don't forget he got blocked by Wemby 5 times and was also in foul trouble all night
	🤣
	🥳🤡
	😆.. Wemby got  killed by a bum from the street for 40 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
	Gilly Gill rookie
	Joaquin Martinez  bum
	Gilly Gill The Future
	you need a pg
	Gilly Gill yep
	We traded him to Boston 😒
	Joaquin Martinez  he's wasn't a pg at that time ya traded him to Atlanta that was dumb
	Gilly Gill talking about Derrick white
	Joaquin Martinez  he wasn't a pg  he's was sh.grd
	Gilly Gill he was with the spurs
	And Celtics use him he same way
	Joaquin Martinez  we use as a pg spurs didnt
	Gilly Gill they did
	Joaquin Martinez  no fool that was Murrary  you don't even know your own team esta vato lol
	Gilly Gill Murray left first and we kept white and used him as point guard
	Nambeee... Puro Celtic 💪  ☘️  green machine  papa....
	Wow
	Thats why Wemby isnt DPOY worthy. Sengun puts a career high on his head while Embiid humiliate him with 70pts. No player should win DPOY as a 28th seed out of 30 teams.
