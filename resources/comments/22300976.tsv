	We are so garbage on defense 😒
	With no Giannis - great stats and great win -
	Neither team plays good defense, so they aren’t going deep in the playoffs… That’s a ridiculous number of points to give up.
	Joe Butner Buck's best defender and lead scorer didn't play, and it was Middleton's first game back after missing like 16 games... Suns fully healthy. As for the Buck's defense, most of the season it HAS been pretty bad, but it's gotten a lot better since Doc came to town. If you actually paid attention to the Bucks, you'd know this. Peace.

	Joe Butner or maybe they’re just really good players that can score? Unlike the 80s and 90s where most players didn’t have an offhand shot and sucked. Low scoring back then wasn’t cause of defense it was because players were dookie

	Dame should be in MVP race after everything he's going though and still doesn't let us down still dame time ⌚
	All that Doc Rivers hate has quiet down I see 👀…I know, I know…wait for the playoff lol
	Miguel A. Jones wait until the playoffs
	Such a great game
	Great play dame😍 and the rest
	Kd thinks he's one of best ever is laughable,he beat LeBron yes,but he had curry Thompson in there prime as well, yes I agree kd is great and yes he's a hof player,but nowhere near the goat
	Jeremy Riesgraf when did KD told you he was the goat??
	Lapoe Diama he said that not long ago,he should be in the  goat conversation
	🐐.. he's definitely top 10 of all time tho
	Lapoe Diama absolutely agree
	🐐 🐐 conversation.. but he will as the top 5 NBA player  of all time guarantee..
	The Court General strikes again! No Giannis No Problem - Damian Lillard
	Just said this when Giannis can let Dame be the primary ball handler and decision maker ..it makes his job easier and the team better.. hes the best player but let the flow of the  game dictate it  ..he holds the ball and it's not that efficient ..he always going to score great leaders put their teams in position to be efficient ..like Jokic or Lebron ..no knock he's the best and the heart just predictable..
	Guys turned up since they were sayin he lost it 🤣💪🏾💯
	THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING OUT THOSE
