	Protect this team at all cost!!
	 yo wassup I got a special some for you hmu rn ❤️💯
	The next big thing! no hole in his game
	 he's got a few lol, started 0-7 again today but turned it up later...also cant get his fts any higher than 69-70%...once he does that it's 24-25 pg with the 7 boards and 5-6 dimes...plus 3pt stroke has gone down since season started so he needs to fine tune his 3 ball this summer too, playoffs will be good for him to learn  how to control a game from opening and bring more defensive intensity like his 4 blk game last week
	Better than Zion
	thank you magic, lakers top 6 continues 🤭
	 kung mananalo sila sa cavs at timberwolves pwede ....pero olats o kaya panay panalo nung nasa ibabaw nila gaya ng kings at suns medyo tagilid yan
	The pelicans are not a championship contender. Better give the playoffs spot to the Suns
