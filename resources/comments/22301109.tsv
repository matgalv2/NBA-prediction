	Better than Zion
	Protect this team at all cost!!
	❤️💯
	The next big thing! no hole in his game
	Basketball Genius he's got a few lol, started 0-7 again today but turned it up later...also cant get his fts any higher than 69-70%...once he does that it's 24-25 pg with the 7 boards and 5-6 dimes...plus 3pt stroke has gone down since season started so he needs to fine tune his 3 ball this summer too, playoffs will be good for him to learn  how to control a game from opening and bring more defensive intensity like his 4 blk game last week
	thank you magic, lakers top 6 continues 🤭
	Monica Torres kung mananalo sila sa cavs at timberwolves pwede ....pero olats o kaya panay panalo nung nasa ibabaw nila gaya ng kings at suns medyo tagilid yan
	The pelicans are not a championship contender. Better give the playoffs spot to the Suns
	Magic Pelicans in the finals please.
	🤝❤️
	Lyndell Jrl Johnson LoL u awake from your dream yet big dawg?
	Another game where he shot for 30 plus points. Good! He needs to do that more often for them to win more.

	Thank you Magic from Suns Fan
	Sonny Ricarde
	Thank you magic, pels lost, suns win 📈

	Pelicans have zion in the paint and a small ball magic group can overpower them?
	Dang. McCollum would look nice next to Franchero…

	From April 8th the darkness will accelerate, there will be more and more evil... Do not look at the eclipse or go outside. Turn to GOD - JESUS CHRIST, the warnings are over. I'll leave in my comments what needs to be done 👇🏻👇🏻

	Pelicans exposed just before playoffs, as expected. Have always been mentally weak
