	Suns are getting hot at the right time! #BelieveInTheSuns
	Okc and wolves maybe the weakest top seeds. Will take mavs, clippers suns or lakers over them
	Abraham Colonel hmm not really OKC is missing it’s 2 best players and Wolves been winning everything, they just lost this one
	Abraham Colonel sun's can't handle okc or twolves healthy.
	Abraham Colonel how many times okc beat the suns this season?
	Abraham Colonel Suns will never play in the finals. It’s a Durant no ring curse.
	Lyn Sheng he won gs
	Lyn Sheng no ring curse wen he got 2 already?? Try again buddy
	Abraham Colonel https://perversehardly.com/mku7wqrb...
	Suns, Mavs, Lakers and Warriors are pushing hard. They´re the true western candiates, along wth Nuggets
	Durant welcom to Suns ❤️
	Nice work kd
	But Suns will never play in the finals. It’s a Durant no ring curse.
	Lyn Sheng 2 rings, 2 finals MVPs

	KD also guarded T-wolves best player most of the game. Not too many star players take that challenge.
	Here come all the bandwagon Suns fans after a 3 game winning streak 😄 🤣
	Carlos Taylor https://perversehardly.com/mku7wqrb...
	They will still play for the other playoffs contenders. Can they maintain their position, after the regular season?
	Upset win for sure
	Great scorer with super skills, GOAT
	"Suns the most dangerous team in the west.. everyone was saying ""o they have the hardest ending schedule in 30 years"" and they beat everyone besides okc... lol 😂"
	Joseph Pistons Smith https://perversehardly.com/mku7wqrb...
	There defense was awesome!
	Keep winning, that's all.
	Going into the playoffs playing good ball Boyz☄️☄️☄️
	Hlatang may iniiwasan ang wolves.c edwards tutok na tutok mga tiraintis pa.
	Kevin Durant

	3rd game in 4 nights, no Towns, and it's a road game.  If this were a well rested Timberwolves team and full strength with Towns back, the Suns would get destroyed.
	Now this is bad for the Lakers! Oh well! Can’t expect other teams to do the job for you! Just keep winning and let the dice fall where they may.
	Nuggets nation thanks you, Suns, for taking down Minnesota! Our interests are temporarily aligned, but then we'll meet in the playoffs

	His scoring? 22?
	I think is good 👍
	But you guys just said the Suns had the toughest schedule to close the season???  🤣🤣🤣🤣 clowns
	Mario, they’re right, that’s a rough sked to finish the season.
	EasyMoneySniper
	straight viiictory
	Euroligue?
	😂
	KD could have scored more but …
	💯
	Giancarlo Ferruzzi My guy, they played amazing defence. Booker focused on sharing the ball and had 13 assists. Don't know why they didn't put it here
	Giancarlo Ferruzzi whatever splits they have booker KD and Grayson can take as many shots as they want regarding their efficiency that night. KD may be the most experienced but he was never the one to take the most shots. Look at it in Brooklyn and OKC. I’ve also seen Durant shoot 14 times and score 30 so the amount of shots doesn’t mean anything. You’re overreacting for one game buddy, and you forgot they got the win.
	Come on, suns

	Gotta remember that this time around the pump we had was not as big as other times. So the drop may not be as bad this time around too. It would make sense as well. That being said, Trading went  smooth for me from day trade with Trading Circle in few weeks. Luke Maxwell
