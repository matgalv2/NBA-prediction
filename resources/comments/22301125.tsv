	Welcome To Play Off Suns 👏👏
	Okc and wolves maybe the weakest top seeds. Will take mavs, clippers suns or lakers over them
	 Suns will never play in the finals. It’s a Durant no ring curse.
	Suns are getting hot at the right time! 
	Suns, Mavs, Lakers and Warriors are pushing hard. They´re the true western candiates, along wth Nuggets
	Durant welcom to Suns ❤️
	Nice work kd
	Here come all the bandwagon Suns fans after a 3 game winning streak 😄 🤣
	But Suns will never play in the finals. It’s a Durant no ring curse.
	KD also guarded T-wolves best player most of the game. Not too many star players take that challenge.
	Upset win for sure
	Great scorer with super skills, GOAT
	Suns the most dangerous team in the west.. everyone was saying 
	They will still play for the other playoffs contenders. Can they maintain their position, after the regular season?
	There defense was awesome!
	Keep winning, that's all.
	❤️❤️🔥😋
	😀
	Suns are getting hot at the right time! 
	3rd game in 4 nights, no Towns, and it's a road game.  If this were a well rested Timberwolves team and full strength with Towns back, the Suns would get destroyed.
	Now this is bad for the Lakers! Oh well! Can’t expect other teams to do the job for you! Just keep winning and let the dice fall where they may.
	Nuggets nation thanks you, Suns, for taking down Minnesota! Our interests are temporarily aligned, but then we'll meet in the playoffs
	I think is good 👍
	KD could have scored more but …
	❤️❤️❤️
	Gotta remember that this time around the pump we had was not as big as other times. So the drop may not be as bad this time around too. It would make sense as well. That being said, Trading went  smooth for me from day trade with Trading Circle in few weeks. 
	I'm legitimately giving a helping hand for the first FIVE lucky persons to MESSAGE ME
