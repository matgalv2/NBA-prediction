	Every person in here clowning on Wemby is going to wish they had him on their team as his career progresses.
	Alex Bosquez Anybody that clowning on Wemby don't know Basketball or knows nothing about Sports.There are many nuisances online who jump on bandwagon.
	I love how creative Jokic gets when facing Wemby. He has to pull out all the stops.
	Wemby has a brighter future than we have imagined
	Chet and Wemby need to train their body and they will be one of the greatest Centers in NBA like Shaq, Yao Ming and Kai Sotto🔥
	the problem is wemby shouldn’t actually be playing center.   hes not strong enough for that position.  
	Everyone talking bout wemby's nearly triple double but he missed 9 of last 10 shots and was %31 from the field, so you call this game an incredible performance?
	Man nobody stands a chance against these boys. Just give them the title again
	Best centre in the game
	Chris Paynter by a long shot
	🖨️ yes. I believe that is about it.
	They got a run for their money. Next season will be a lot  better GSG!

	Nikola Jokic Is The Best Player In Basketball 🏀

	Sometimes you just got to call a spade.A spade hangs down.You are the best player in the NBA hangs down.It's not even close
	How wemby cant score well againts center jokic
	Whatever Wemby does, he will never surpass Lebron James as the goat, but he already surpassed Michael Jordan.
