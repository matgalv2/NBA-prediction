TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Every person in here clowning on Wemby is going to wish they had him on their team as his career progresses.
	 he's someone the spurs can build around for sure.
	 Anybody that clowning on Wemby don't know Basketball or knows nothing about Sports.There are many nuisances online who jump on bandwagon.
	 once Wemby starts getting 36 minutes per game his stats are going to be insane. Build around him with a few of his  🇫🇷 teammates.
	As expected wemby can't win with his team shame on him 🤪🤪🤪👈
	 Wemby almost had a quadruple double
	 cry out loud chet 🤣🤣🤣
	 wow many mins did Wemby play vs Jokic? Interested to know!
	 delete Facebook
	I love how creative Jokic gets when facing Wemby. He has to pull out all the stops.
	 you know he's shook when he actually starts dunking😂
	 That's because he calculated in his mind that he's going to have to go right after this guy in order to avoid the block. He doesn't have to do that with hardly anybody else in the league lol. It's cool to watch.
	And 9 blocks. The kid is a threat.
	Wemby has a brighter future than we have imagined
	Robin Pride we imagined he was better than Lebum and Jordan combined
	 9/29 from field 👌
	 Exactly. In the future he wont shoot that bad, so the stat line will look like a 40 pts quadruple double.
	 And 15 rebs 8 asts and 9 blks.
	 and 20 bricks 🤣
	 kobe did that a lot of time and is one of the greatness
	 You make it seem like he shoots poorly often.
	 46 % not impressive at all , maybe in the future will be good player but it’s still long way to go
	" 46% is impressive for him taking the kinds of shots he's taking. Wemby is not taking a lot of high percentage shots. There are some 3s and 15-20ft jumpers in there. Most guards aren't shooting 46 from the field today. When he matures a bit… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 46 in 2 points and 31 in 3 . He’s first option in Spurs intresting if Spurs gets a star how it will work
	 Like I said, that's impressive considering the types of shots he's taking. He's the first option but he's also a rookie.......I wouldn't be worried if I were you because he's still leading his team.
	 can’t say leading they one of worst teams 🤦
	 the team is bad but he's still leading. Having a bad team doesn't make a person not a leader.
	the problem is wemby shouldn’t actually be playing center.   hes not strong enough for that position.  
	 soon he will be strongest player.
	 strength is irrelevant
	Billy Skelly,the spurs has win?
	 Don’t watch much Basketball do you?
	 with 9 blocks, plenty of rebound and a threat defensively, he is pretty much a center.
	 Remember when he blocked Janis in the paint a few weeks ago ? Janis tried to bully him, as he does with everybody, but it didn’t work with Wemby.
	Chet and Wemby need to train their body and they will be one of the greatest Centers in NBA like Shaq, Yao Ming and Kai Sotto🔥
	Everyone talking bout wemby's nearly triple double but he missed 9 of last 10 shots and was %31 from the field, so you call this game an incredible performance?
	Michel Curtis Dimassy what a hater 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 a hater
	 The kid tried though
	 he also had 9 blocks . Just wait until next year when the Spurs have actually upgraded their roster. This was an evaluation season . If he can stay healthy, Wemby is going to usher in another  Duncan like era for the Spurs.
	 💯
	" It was a near quadruple-double homie, so yea, anytime someone gets close to thats its usually impressive.  The shots didnt fall for him tonight and that happens - he is a 20yr old rookie after all... consistency will come.   Spurs… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 funny thing is his fg and 3pt averages are better than rookie KD
	" It's crazy how people put the bar so high up for wemby, and then when he doesnt produce on any given night they come out to exclaim their distaste for seeing such a great young talent.. lol. Whats incredible? That a 20yr old rookie can pl… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 not triple double. A quad double. 2 assists and 1 block from doing something no current NBA player has and nobody this century.
	 🤡 take.
	 no floor facilitator, and play maker to set him up
	 Bruh he’s a rookie almost putting a quadruple double on a bad team what more do you want from a rookie💀💀 unrealistic expectations he’s already done more than most rookies
	 Lol. It's not a near triple double. He also had 9 blocks, so it's a near quadruple double.
	 yes he almost had a quadruple double not just a triple double. Yes he missed a lot of shots. I’m sure you agree that he scored more then double digits and I’m sure you agree that missing shots doesn’t take away from his rebounds assists and blocks. Right?
	100%, he was the only reason the game was close. But those misses also lost them the game
	this guy is becoming a wizard
	Man nobody stands a chance against these boys. Just give them the title again
	The spurs has win?
	 No
	Tracie hanson,thanks
	 barely beating the Spurs when they were missing three of their main players. Yeah they can be beat.
	🖨️ yes. I believe that is about it.
	Best centre in the game
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Denver Nuggets
	Better than LeBron
	Best in the League 🏀⭐💯
	That was exciting game
	They got a run for their money. Next season will be a lot  better GSG!

	Nikola Jokic Is The Best Player In Basketball 🏀
	Don’t forget he is a rookie and doing things none of them did when they were rookies.

	Wonderful game.
	Whatever Wemby does, he will never surpass Lebron James as the goat, but he already surpassed Michael Jordan.
