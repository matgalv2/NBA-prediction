	Start of Sixers' downfall!
	Brooklyn Nets Vs Philadelphia 76ers
	Good to see another win. Just hoping we can do something before the trade deadline to bolster this team. A PG would be nice.
	David Cockayne we already have an elite one. He just happens to have certain, uhh, availability issues.
	Andy Giurtalis Thats why we need a sub PG that would end up playing most of the season in the starting line up. 🙂
	Wow sixers without embiid is gonna be tough for them
	"KD called him ""mini"" on their last game and decided to drop 40 pts today lmao"
