	NBA should just let them battle it out for the rest of the season , to see who can get dead last 😂
	Zacari Fisher Wild hahaha like they have their own series for the last 8 games hahahha loser destroys the team and lets a new franchise be born elsewhere like seattle and then add a vegas team honestly i hope the wizards lose
