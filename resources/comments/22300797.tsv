TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	This kid is quite the pleasant surprise!! He is the kind of all out player that makes a  good team....... great. Consequently this team has a very very good shot at giving Boston another Banner. Go Celtics!
	I admire Boston Celtics, they're not an individual team, they work as group. That's something very good.
	Grimmjow Jaggerjack Just like the NY Knicks 👍
	Derek White is so valuable to what this team is trying to achieve. They will need him in the post season if they want to compete for a championship.
	When they traded for this guy I thought very little of it. I just looked at it like a depth piece trade. What an amazing fit this guy ended up being. Plays hard, plays smart, plays unselfishly. So glad he's on this team.
	Top 10 NBA player right now!
	Matt Granat let's tap the brakes
	Dennis Wright 
	Tommy Award worthy  🏀
	Man keeps pulling the Celtics out of holes. Plus, he's such an underrated defender he shocks opponents with his efforts. Vucevic was perplexed when White blocked his shot 😅
	DWhite hoopin this season☘️🏀
	D. White the backbone of the Celtics!
	Super Star, always making things happen on the court 
	MUP - most underrated player in the league!
	Insane how good he is.
	Hope they draft Zach Eddy to Celtics,
	More players need to take note……
	WTG CELTICS ❤🍀🏀

	Boston Celtics Vs Chicago Bulls
	And all it took was shaving his head!
	He Is A Keeper 👍☘.
	But “he’s not an All-Star” 🙄
	I bet they'll lose in the first round if they play the bulls
	Can’t believe this incredible 2-way player didn’t make the allstar team 🤦‍♂️
	☘️ Let’s Go Celtics ☘️
	He's been a new man this year since he got rid of that Krusty the clown hair
	Underrated idol ❤️

	Emmanuel Almeda you could have done that..
	"Ima do this once, sending 5 grand to the first 6 people to message me with ""LUCKY ME"" cus i feel some people are going through difficulties, Y'all stay Blessed"
	They shoot 2’s they lose - they shoot 3’s they win
	"A supportive message for those in our state dealing with tax or bill issues – chime in with a ""GOD DID,"" and the first four responders might just find a boost of 5 grands coming their way!"
