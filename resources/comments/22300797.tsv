TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
BOS	This kid is quite the pleasant surprise!! He is the kind of all out player that makes a  good team....... great. Consequently this team has a very very good shot at giving Boston another Banner. Go Celtics!
BOS	I admire Boston Celtics, they're not an individual team, they work as group. That's something very good.
	Grimmjow Jaggerjack Just like the NY Knicks 👍
BOS	Derek White is so valuable to what this team is trying to achieve. They will need him in the post season if they want to compete for a championship.
BOS	When they traded for this guy I thought very little of it. I just looked at it like a depth piece trade. What an amazing fit this guy ended up being. Plays hard, plays smart, plays unselfishly. So glad he's on this team.
	Top 10 NBA player right now!
	Matt Granat let's tap the brakes
	Dennis Wright 
	Tommy Award worthy  🏀
BOS	Man keeps pulling the Celtics out of holes. Plus, he's such an underrated defender he shocks opponents with his efforts. Vucevic was perplexed when White blocked his shot 😅
