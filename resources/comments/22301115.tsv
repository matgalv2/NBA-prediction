	That's amazing! Brandon Miller really showed his dominance on the court and helped the Charlotte Hornets defend their home against the Magic. And both Miles Bridges and Paolo Banchero had outstanding performances with 32 points each. They really brought their A-game! Thanks for sharing the link, I'll definitely check out the final score. 🏀🔥
