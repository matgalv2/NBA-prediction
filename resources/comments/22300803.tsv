TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAS	Times sure change. Spurs used to be 45-11 back in the day lol 😂
SAS	Matt Cleveland III Tell me about it as a Spurs fan I never thought I would see them lose this much lol
SAS	Spurs started to be better they now being in the game till last seconds
SAC	De'Aaron Fox
SAC	Sabonis is the most underrated player in the league
	Cody Faria someone needs to clock him hard at the beginning of games.
	Gilbert Joseph Duran just like he did to your boy Wemby
	Cody Faria You’re talking about the hard pick on Johnson. That was legit. The reason I say that is because it didn’t affect Wembanyama and his double double. Someone needs to foul Sabonis so hard it removes him from the game. It’s nothing personal. It’s business. It just needs to happen.
	Gilbert Joseph Duran so someone needs to do something illegal to the player that’s whooping your team. That’s some high level respect. Sabonis over your favorite player. Light the beam cry baby
	Cody Faria it’s part of the game and the way basketball is played. Sabonis plays that way. I respect that. When you have a player like that you need to attack him and make him think. No one is saying to do anything illegal. You make a good solid statement. If it gets called a foul, you take it like a man. If not, you play on. He just needs to be put on his back. That’s how champs do it. You’ve just started watching basketball this decade I’m guessing. You’re crying over someone saying that Sabonis and any other “tough guy” player needs to be put in his place early in the game. You probably cried when Horry smacked Nash. Grow up soy boy. It’s a man’s game.
	Gilbert Joseph Duran lmfao you crying way too much. Keep throwing them stupid comments my way, it’s entertaining. Light the beam spurs boy. Sabonis with a triple double on your sorry team
	Gilbert Joseph Duran now you sending me messages all mad 🤣 soft af
	Cody Faria I said have a latte. You are crying so much because I said someone needs to put Sabonis in his place. Are you his lover?
	Gilbert Joseph Duran bro you're weird go do something.
	Gilbert Joseph Duran damn I've never seen someone so butthurt over getting whooped by Sabonis. Unfortunate for you, it's gonna keep happening
SAC	Fox and Sabonis are all stars regardless of what the squads were…
SAC	38th straight double-double and 19th triple-double this season for Sabonis!!👏🏻👏🏻
	Edna Dong Kuyama and they say he isn't an All Star or even in the running for MVP...the NBA is turning into all about the MONEY...what a jole the commisioner and everyone involved have become.
SAS	Spurs today is totally out especially this Season i think, Pop should stop playing around wemby and apply team game
SAS	Spurs need to get rid of that burden Sochan.
	Shohei Yamamoto its his 2 or 3rd season i believe and hes still young give him time
