	LA CLIPPERS na ko
LAC	Not 8 straight.  7/8.  They  lost to CLE on 1/29.  Still impressive run, though 🔥
LAC	The Clippers might go to the NBA finals if they keep this up, I mean that Clippers went to the Western Conference finals however they lost to  Phoenix in 2021.
	Karl Ahlf yeah without Kawhi...teams fear a healthy Kawhi that's why the trolls have quieted down cause they know he can upset just about ANY team he's proven it lol
	La mejor desición que clippers hizo eh darle la posición de point guard armador base a James harden después de eso todo cambio Rusell wesbrookt se la se dio esa posición número 1 el récord desde que el entro al equipo fue de 29-13 entoce si tú me dice … Wyświetl więcej
