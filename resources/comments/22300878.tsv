TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHX	Durant can’t win anything without Steph Curry.
PHX	Michael William Cassidy Not  True... Steph Curry can't win anything SINCE Kevin Durant!!!
PHX	Victoria Weems Warriors won a championship after Durant left LOL SMH stop it.
OKC	Sga kawhi and tatum should be the mvp contenders. Predic for a young team first round exit to seventh seed lakers a good run already
PHX	Just tell the Phoenix Suns we ain't a contender still because we can't play defense and play smart on offense
	He’s so calm
OKC	He is the 🐐 Goat 🤝
OKC	He didn’t put on a scoring clinic, he gets what the Sun gives him. Play a great game, score when needed. Didn’t force the issue when phoenix decided to double.
PHX	Yes. The dumb Suns lost. Our little Canadian will finish second in the MVP vote.
PHX	Kevin Durant can't score a single point in the 4th quarter after the Suns take a six point lead in the 3rd? Please get well soon Booker.
PHX	Craig Haptonstall you must not have seen him throw a 3-1 lead to GSW before jumping ship to said team
PHX	Craig Haptonstall and the turnover on him as well , but there will be nights that someone won’t play the way we want .
OKC	How hard would it have been to double team Shai and hope the others don’t hit shots 🤦🏽‍♂️
OKC	What a great week end. The Lakers, the Suns and GSW are lost !!! 👍
OKC	Congratulations! What game !
OKC	He’s got a Kobe smile
PHX	As a suns fan I’m losing faith in this team every game. And we have the toughest remaining schedule, I fear we will be on a big losing streak probably like 6-7 games especially with no Booker. Team shoot’s itself in the foot every game.
	Tyler Bixler hey handsome  I would like to know you more better if you don’t mind sending  me a request
	Tyler Bixler the old team was better
	Tyler Bixler you actually have the easiest remaining schedule.
OKC	SGA AND A FULLY HEALTHY JAI  MORRANT  ONE ON ONE GOING TO TWENTY  IN FOUR SEGMENTS WOULD BE MUST SEE TV
OKC	OkC is Pretty good 1st round exit here they come

	Emmit Smith On your profile it says your an actor.  Must be pretty good.  Over here acting like you know something about hoop.
	😂🤷🏽‍♂️
OKC	Emmit Smith I’m a Thunder fan and I believe that as well. We haven’t had the experiences yet and that might cost us. Plus, we are getting our rebounding every night.
	Emmit Smith L
PHX	Show KD who's in his prime
	first round exit by gsw 😂😂
PHX	I honestly thought Phoenix would tear it up this year. I guess I’m wrong.
	Keith Arnold hello dear how are you am new here kindly send me friend request so that we can now each other
	Keith Arnold suns window for title is closed.
PHX	Keith Arnold Nah, i remember me and my homies triping when we saw Suns as a Western favourites right after Cam and Bridges trade for KD, we knew it its a bs, becouse they sent their best defensive player in brooklyn, so they playing like i expected them to play, since they doesnt have any good defense, both KD and DBook must score 30+ maybe they have a chance to win a game.
PHX	Suns were team that most is most looked a like contenders, same story as as a celtics , they were already at the top 9ff the league , they didnt choked in cials , bucks were too strong and too phisisycal for them that year, but if suns organization had more patiente ,let chemistry growing , players whold keep improving , but new owner screw everything . Btw i liked suns with brodges , cam ayton and cp3
OKC	Congratulations  Shia  and the team is awesome
OKC	Huge win
OKC	Does it every game!
OKC	Best SG right now
PHX	Suns good only at start no ending
	This is the reason why LeBron is light years better than Michael Jordog🐕. Michael Jordog 🐕 would be Anthony Bennett level if he played 21 seasons.
	All other arguments are considered dumb and large volume cap 🧢 
	Gadjin brons a pussy that has to act on a little touch for a foul..bro has no college creds..MJ the only GOAT..tell me what Js u have compared to Brons..biggest flopper ever is his greatest achievement..
