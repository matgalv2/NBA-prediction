MIN	the #twolves are back on the top at the west, tied with the nuggets!!! the bucks suffered their 3rd straight lose 🙁
SPAM	Pinoy Ako Hello baby how are you doing today ? I’m available for fun , incall and outcall available  and would you like to meet ?
MIL	OK, so their tied for best record in the west and Edwards is being recognized as a very very talented player who is a handful to guard. In my opinion he's missing one thing and coming to play every single night. He's young with no significant injuries. I love this dude and I'm sure he can get even better. #unstoppable
MIL	Let's Go Milwaukee Doe!
MIL	Are they going to fire Doc Rivers.....the guy is just an overrated Coach
	Alvin M. Rañola soon 😁
MIL	Doc rivers really messed up the bucks
SPAM	Jorge Gomez Hello baby how are you doing today ? I’m available for fun , incall and outcall available  and would you like to meet ?
MIL	The Bucks are beating them selves so far
MIL	Go Doc!  Keep this up so you will not be called a playoff choaker
MIL	It really is Coach Griffin's fault
MIL	Hahaha another loss for bucks.
MIL	Giannis going to be thinking about Kareem.
MIL	If Coach Rivers was hired to make the team feel how to lose, he's doing good so far😂

MIL	Doc was supposed to “fix the defense” LOL. 129pts later and 1-5 since Doc took over,OUCH.
MIL	The Buck's court is one of the hardest courts to play at; however, the Wolves were able to come away with a victory ✌️. Top mentality, top approach, and flawlessly executed. Big up to the Wolves.
MIN	The Wolves are Hot!
MIL	Doc taking Ls. Guess the coach wasn't the problem.  It's the players.
MIN	Couldn't even get a triple double, I thought he was meant to be good?? Lachlan Cooke
	Yeah you see what I’m talking about championship I smell want your what up Big Homie
MIL	Dame don't fit ,can't play D ,with an over rated ,exposed coach! But you won't give Mark Jackson chance?
