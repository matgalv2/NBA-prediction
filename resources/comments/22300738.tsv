TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	the #twolves are back on the top at the west, tied with the nuggets!!! the bucks suffered their 3rd straight lose 🙁
	Pinoy Ako Hello baby how are you doing today ? I’m available for fun , incall and outcall available  and would you like to meet ?
	OK, so their tied for best record in the west and Edwards is being recognized as a very very talented player who is a handful to guard. In my opinion he's missing one thing and coming to play every single night. He's young with no significant injuries. I love this dude and I'm sure he can get even better. #unstoppable
	Let's Go Milwaukee Doe!
	Are they going to fire Doc Rivers.....the guy is just an overrated Coach
	Alvin M. Rañola soon 😁
	Doc rivers really messed up the bucks
	Jorge Gomez Hello baby how are you doing today ? I’m available for fun , incall and outcall available  and would you like to meet ?
	The Bucks are beating them selves so far
	Go Doc!  Keep this up so you will not be called a playoff choaker
	It really is Coach Griffin's fault
	Hahaha another loss for bucks.
	Giannis going to be thinking about Kareem.
	If Coach Rivers was hired to make the team feel how to lose, he's doing good so far😂
	Nakarma cguro Ang bucks sa pagpatalsik Kay coach griffin
	"Coach Doc ""Jinx"" Rivers doing his insanity stuff."

	Steve La Rue Need to do it in the playoffs again tho.
	Chris Green If the Lakers can even get that far...
	Steve La Rue They'll be there.
	Chris Green Nuggets will win with ease. Another sweep for the Nuggets if they meet in the playoffs.

	Doc was supposed to “fix the defense” LOL. 129pts later and 1-5 since Doc took over,OUCH.
	The Buck's court is one of the hardest courts to play at; however, the Wolves were able to come away with a victory ✌️. Top mentality, top approach, and flawlessly executed. Big up to the Wolves.
	The Wolves are Hot!
	Doc taking Ls. Guess the coach wasn't the problem.  It's the players.
	Couldn't even get a triple double, I thought he was meant to be good?? Lachlan Cooke
	Yeah you see what I’m talking about championship I smell want your what up Big Homie
	Dame don't fit ,can't play D ,with an over rated ,exposed coach! But you won't give Mark Jackson chance?
	Wasnt expecting much from this game with injuries and still figuring out the team with new coach.
	What Doc Rivers brings to the Bucks?? 😅
