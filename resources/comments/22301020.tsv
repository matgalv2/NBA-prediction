	I'm rolling with the Kings all the way
	That ain’t going off, that’s just him. He is consistent and not given enough credit imo
	This team needs to figure out a way to beat bottom of the barrel teams.
	De'Aaron Fox

	That’s a great win, considering they lost 😠 to the wizards the other night.
	Sac and Min are both loved by the refs and ..... You know what i mean.
	 lies
	 are you watching their games? Come on.
	 I’ve watched every game. That is all lies.
	It’s a dang shame the Magic get no publicity at all. They having a heck of a season.
	Fox is inconsistent
	That foul called on fox with 25sec left was just stupid asf ref waited for fox to touch the half court line before he called it in. it was way way late by 3-4 secs
	Sacramento Kings Vs Orlando Magic
	 change your name to Captain obvious
	Nice ref late call
	Congrats 🍾🎉
