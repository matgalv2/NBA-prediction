TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I'm rolling with the Kings all the way
	That ain’t going off, that’s just him. He is consistent and not given enough credit imo
	Carson Hulowski if you call 10/30 shots for 25 points consistent in wizards game
	Tsung Sizzle you act like he ain’t allowed to have an off game on a back to back that they had to fly into two different cities and not check in to their hotel until 1 am and then play an early game at 4
	This team needs to figure out a way to beat bottom of the barrel teams.

	Foxy is so exciting! Good win! Light the beam!💜🖤
	Last 2 free-throw by Fox was BS!!!! Refs shouldn't had called that..ruined the game
	Danq ISh-only it's the correct call, stupid ref waited like 2 secs to blow rhe whistle.
	Danq ISh-only yes the ref sucks the first one had contact but he out of balance theres no a foul
	Danq ISh-only You mean Fox finally got a call... don't see you complaining about ya boy hitting fox in the nuts and getting away with it.
	Danq ISh-only you must be a Magic fan. Definite foul. Any time you have your hand on their waist then shove it's a foul. Plus he got hit in the groin previously on an obvious foul and no foul was called. Facts!
	Loose against wizard but takeover against magic sacramento is very special🤣
	Moana CF lose
	That’s a great win, considering they lost 😠 to the wizards the other night.

	Sac and Min are both loved by the refs and ..... You know what i mean.
	Ric Driguez lies
	Marc Garcia are you watching their games? Come on.
	Ric Driguez I’ve watched every game. That is all lies.
	Ric Driguez https://t.me/+4wbZFKpnuRMwNjNk
	Ric Driguez the Kings probably get burned the most by the refs. Look how few free throws they get. If you watch the games, you’ll see that Fox and Sabonis get beat up every time they are in the paint with no calls
	Man as a pelican fan that sucks....but we beat the heat!
	It’s a dang shame the Magic get no publicity at all. They having a heck of a season.

	Fox is inconsistent
	Wesley Herrera https://t.me/+4wbZFKpnuRMwNjNk
	That foul called on fox with 25sec left was just stupid asf ref waited for fox to touch the half court line before he called it in. it was way way late by 3-4 secs
	Sacramento Kings Vs Orlando Magic
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling https://t.me/+4wbZFKpnuRMwNjNk
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling change your name to Captain obvious
	Nice ref late call
	Sabas.. 21pts and 15rebs again.. bro when they going to start recognising the bro.. 52nd consecutive double double..
	Congrats 🍾🎉
