	These used to be an average night for him 😕
	Wow 😲, That's Amazing!! 👌😍 Congratulations Warrior's, Good Job! 💯👌🏀🏀🏀 Good Luck For The Next Game, 🙏🤞🤞😍😍😍🏀🏀🏀🏀😍
	Best Choice Match up against OKC.
	Klay is most definitely back took him the whole season but he’s back just in time
	All for naught cause they’re still the 10th seed and would have to beat the Kings to even get to the second game of the play-in! Goodluck! Not! 😅
	Congrats warriors you really great
	Crazy how only 2 years ago they were a top the west and now the young guys matured and took over. West is so good this season.
	Surprised NBA didn’t mess up the headline on this one
	Warriors you made the right choice vs Sac than Lakers//NO avoiding Denver in the 1st round of the playoffs if you can advance .
	They’re gonna beat the team they play in the playoffs. They’re missing two players the Kings missing the six men of the year and the other kid that could play. That’s pretty nice. The Warriors are gonna beat them. I don’t see the king is winning. They’re gonna expose the king center for what he is, don’t let him get down low because he can’t shoot from the outside
	Out of the playoffs Warriors! Goodbye! 👋 😆
	What a game. GSW secured the 10th spot. 😂
	And remain 10. Thats all 🤭🤭🤭
	No Curry, No problem
	Oh yeah Whoaah!😆👍 Let's go San Francisco😎👍 my mamaah men dude😎😁👍 (Draymond Green) will saves the day😁👍 oh come on😅✌

	Klay Thompson for 3 bang🎯
	Not only did he score but he was also making plays for his team mates. The bench played an awesome game
	Go Klay!!!!! YOU'RE AWESOME!!!!!

	The NBA is really set the match up against Kings VS Warriors.
	Utah Jazz Vs Golden State Warriors
