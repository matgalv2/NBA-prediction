GSW	These used to be an average night for him 😕
GSW	Wow 😲, That's Amazing!! 👌😍 Congratulations Warrior's, Good Job! 💯👌🏀🏀🏀 Good Luck For The Next Game, 🙏🤞🤞😍😍😍🏀🏀🏀🏀😍
GSW	Best Choice Match up against OKC.
GSW	Klay is most definitely back took him the whole season but he’s back just in time
GSW	All for naught cause they’re still the 10th seed and would have to beat the Kings to even get to the second game of the play-in! Goodluck! Not! 😅
GSW	Congrats warriors you really great
UTA	Crazy how only 2 years ago they were a top the west and now the young guys matured and took over. West is so good this season.
	Surprised NBA didn’t mess up the headline on this one
GSW	Warriors you made the right choice vs Sac than Lakers//NO avoiding Denver in the 1st round of the playoffs if you can advance .
GSW	They’re gonna beat the team they play in the playoffs. They’re missing two players the Kings missing the six men of the year and the other kid that could play. That’s pretty nice. The Warriors are gonna beat them. I don’t see the king is winning. They’re gonna expose the king center for what he is, don’t let him get down low because he can’t shoot from the outside
GSW	Out of the playoffs Warriors! Goodbye! 👋 😆
GSW	What a game. GSW secured the 10th spot. 😂
GSW	And remain 10. Thats all 🤭🤭🤭
