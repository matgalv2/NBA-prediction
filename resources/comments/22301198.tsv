	These used to be an average night for him 😕
	Best Choice Match up against OKC.
	Wow 😲, That's Amazing!! 👌😍 Congratulations Warrior's, Good Job! 💯👌🏀🏀🏀 Good Luck For The Next Game, 🙏🤞🤞😍😍😍🏀🏀🏀🏀😍
	Klay is most definitely back took him the whole season but he’s back just in time
	All for naught cause they’re still the 10th seed and would have to beat the Kings to even get to the second game of the play-in! Goodluck! Not! 😅
	Congrats warriors you really great
	Crazy how only 2 years ago they were a top the west and now the young guys matured and took over. West is so good this season.
	Surprised  didn’t mess up the headline on this one
	Warriors you made the right choice vs Sac than Lakers//NO avoiding Denver in the 1st round of the playoffs if you can advance .
	They’re gonna beat the team they play in the playoffs. They’re missing two players the Kings missing the six men of the year and the other kid that could play. That’s pretty nice. The Warriors are gonna beat them. I don’t see the king is winning. They’re gonna expose the king center for what he is, don’t let him get down low because he can’t shoot from the outside
	What a game. GSW secured the 10th spot. 😂
	Out of the playoffs Warriors! Goodbye! 👋 😆
	No Curry, No problem
	And remain 10. Thats all 🤭🤭🤭
