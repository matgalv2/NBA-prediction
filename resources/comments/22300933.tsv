TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Battle for who gets relegated to G League
	🤷🏻‍♂️
	😆
	Great player, poor team
	🤷🏻‍♂️
	Justin Miller poor team
	Justin Miller cunningham/pistons = dame/blazers
	Justin Miller very young. Let’s not think the pistons situation is like Washington or anything. This team is very young and some may not make the cut but they have some room for optimism
	Stefano Ferrari I agree the dude plays well but the team chemistry ain’t there with all of em
	They might get more wins than Lions did...barely
	We coming for that  # 1 spot!! Lol
	He will be paid a max when he isn't even a 3 on a great team
	Hornets had 2 free throws in the first half  players play differently when they know calls are going their way
	Jonathan Willoughby and 7/27 In 3 points shots jajajajaja
	a preview of 2090 ECF FINALS
	Dishing points to the Wizards and Pistons back to back
	The battle of the minions 2.0

	The Hornets and Wizards are way worse compared to Detroit
	Charlotte Hornets Vs Detroit Pistons
