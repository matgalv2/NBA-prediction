TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	Lol all the good teams losing today
SAC	Kings just trying to avoid playing Denver the first round.  Kings match up better against OKC plus that would be a good matchup
SAC	Joseph Gonzales yeah, they’re 1/2 game from avoiding OKC and being in the play in and then it gets dicey
SAC	Joseph Gonzales correction, they’re in the 7th seed now and only 1/2 game ahead of Mavericks.
SAC	🤣🤣
SAC	Joseph Gonzales the Kings actually haven't lost to Denver yet
SAC	This was a actually a big loss tonihht
HOU	Rockets need one more year and a good offseason. They are on schedule.
SAC	Strange! Kings has the Lakers number but lose to a Rockets team
SAC	Ferdinand Untalan dude that’s been the kings all year. They are a very confusing team
	Houston Rockets Vs Sacramento Kings
HOU	We're building.
HOU	As a Suns fan, thank you Rockets
SAC	Dave Daryl Jomoc fine yall can lose to the nuggets first round lol
SAC	💀😂
SAC	Dave Daryl Jomoc well true. As a kings fans I think we match up better against the wolves or OKC.  Better chance to get out of the first round
SAC	👍😂
	True I'm kd diehard fans hahaha
SAC	Dave Daryl Jomoc kings and suns are back and forth for weeks now. One of us blows a game and gets knocked into play in and then the other does it lol
	🤣 its like we're watching a do or die game instead it is teams standings 😂

HOU	there is still hope for Houston. Warriors gonna lose some games. Let's Go Rockets!
HOU	Fred did good
HOU	Hope Sengun is okay... 😕
	Christopher Brockhan
	Gilbert Joseph Duran huh?
HOU	Christopher Brockhan he’s a Spurs fan blaming Wembys injury on Sengun because they had a collision. He’s a fool.
	Christopher Brockhan duh?
	Gilbert Joseph Duran it takes a special kind of prick to be glad about a player injury.
	Gawa gawa nyo lang yan para makalimutan namin ang pangako ni cayetano na sampung libo sa bawat pamilya 😒🙄
HOU	Fred is like the old pro organizer. And he isn’t 30 yet.
	Let me guess, Ellis didn’t play
HOU	Prayers up for Sengun.
	Real classy Gilbert Joseph Duran you’re an absolute loser.
	Wilson Reeves
HOU	Gilbert Joseph Duran thinking Sengun injured Wemby on purpose is ridiculous man.
	Wilson Reeves I never mentioned Wemby…
	Wilson Reeves
