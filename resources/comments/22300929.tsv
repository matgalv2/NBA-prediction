TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Lol all the good teams losing today
	Kings just trying to avoid playing Denver the first round.  Kings match up better against OKC plus that would be a good matchup
	Joseph Gonzales yeah, they’re 1/2 game from avoiding OKC and being in the play in and then it gets dicey
	Joseph Gonzales correction, they’re in the 7th seed now and only 1/2 game ahead of Mavericks.
	🤣🤣
	Joseph Gonzales the Kings actually haven't lost to Denver yet
	This was a actually a big loss tonihht
	Rockets need one more year and a good offseason. They are on schedule.
	Strange! Kings has the Lakers number but lose to a Rockets team
	Ferdinand Untalan dude that’s been the kings all year. They are a very confusing team
	Houston Rockets Vs Sacramento Kings
	We're building.
	As a Suns fan, thank you Rockets
	Dave Daryl Jomoc fine yall can lose to the nuggets first round lol
	💀😂
	Dave Daryl Jomoc well true. As a kings fans I think we match up better against the wolves or OKC.  Better chance to get out of the first round
	👍😂
	True I'm kd diehard fans hahaha
	Dave Daryl Jomoc kings and suns are back and forth for weeks now. One of us blows a game and gets knocked into play in and then the other does it lol
	🤣 its like we're watching a do or die game instead it is teams standings 😂
	Incredible this league is!!
	👋👋
	Thnx rockets..
	Ok, thanks houston!
	Playing defense works!
	Way to go Greta!
	there is still hope for Houston. Warriors gonna lose some games. Let's Go Rockets!
	Fred did good
	Hope Sengun is okay... 😕
	Christopher Brockhan
	Gilbert Joseph Duran huh?
	Christopher Brockhan he’s a Spurs fan blaming Wembys injury on Sengun because they had a collision. He’s a fool.
	Christopher Brockhan duh?
	Gilbert Joseph Duran it takes a special kind of prick to be glad about a player injury.
	Gawa gawa nyo lang yan para makalimutan namin ang pangako ni cayetano na sampung libo sa bawat pamilya 😒🙄
	Fred is like the old pro organizer. And he isn’t 30 yet.
	Let me guess, Ellis didn’t play
	Prayers up for Sengun.
	Real classy Gilbert Joseph Duran you’re an absolute loser.
	Wilson Reeves
	Gilbert Joseph Duran thinking Sengun injured Wemby on purpose is ridiculous man.
	Wilson Reeves I never mentioned Wemby…
