	Lol all the good teams losing today
	This was a actually a big loss tonihht
	Kings just trying to avoid playing Denver the first round.  Kings match up better against OKC plus that would be a good matchup
	 yeah, theyâ€™re 1/2 game from avoiding OKC and being in the play in and then it gets dicey
	 correction, theyâ€™re in the 7th seed now and only 1/2 game ahead of Mavericks.
	 man, you need to stop with those excuses. They just lose the game, dont try to overthink it ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
	 the Kings actually haven't lost to Denver yet
	Rockets need one more year and a good offseason. They are on schedule.
	Strange! Kings has the Lakers number but lose to a Rockets team
	 dude thatâ€™s been the kings all year. They are a very confusing team
	Houston Rockets Vs Sacramento Kings
	We're building.
	Incredible this league is!!
	As a Suns fan, thank you Rockets
	Thnx rockets..
	Ok, thanks houston!
	Playing defense works!
	Way to go Greta!
	there is still hope for Houston. Warriors gonna lose some games. Let's Go Rockets!
	Hope Sengun is okay... ðŸ˜•
	
	 huh?
	 heâ€™s a Spurs fan blaming Wembys injury on Sengun because they had a collision. Heâ€™s a fool.
	 duh?
	 it takes a special kind of prick to be glad about a player injury.
	Fred did good
	Gawa gawa nyo lang yan para makalimutan namin ang pangako ni cayetano na sampung libo sa bawat pamilya ðŸ˜’ðŸ™„
	Fred is like the old pro organizer. And he isnâ€™t 30 yet.
	Let me guess, Ellis didnâ€™t play
	Prayers up for Sengun.
	Real classy  youâ€™re an absolute loser.
	
	 thinking Sengun injured Wemby on purpose is ridiculous man.
	 I never mentioned Wembyâ€¦
