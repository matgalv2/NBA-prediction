TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Nothing like the salt from all the low level fans whose teams are so bad they have nothing to talk about but their hate for the Celtics. 😁☘️
	Jordan Hipolito Nothing like  Celtics fans thinking they are Relevant when they can't get to the mountain top and keep failing... Portland fans have no expectations so when The Blazers fail they don't get upset Boston fans have high expectations and will be let down again...
	Patrick Smith
	Jordan Hipolito Don't need a tissue I am not fan of either team I am stating reality...
	Patrick Smith
	Jordan Hipolito foreign fan boyz only know of the Flakers, Dead Dynasty Warriors, and the Regular season champs, the Celtics who will fold in the playoffs
	🤣
	🤡 nobody takes these foreign fan boyz who crack themselves up seriously. They are more interested in pop-culture than good basketball 🏀 
	This team. Going to have 18 banner this 2024! 💚🍀
	It so easy for Boston, they should create a new league for TOP teams as we
	Boston is looking for a championship. Holla at your boy !
	They gonna choke in the playoffs
	Let's Go Celtics this is our Year..
	Nothing like the salt from all the low level fans whose teams are so bad they have nothing to talk about but their hate for the Celtics. 😁☘️
	Choke in playoffs
	🤣🤣
	Javier Adrian Medina play in doesn’t matter lol
	Celtics goin crazy this year
	Kyle Reeves until the playoffs
	Arturo Bugarin they like the cowboys of the nba
	Kyle Reeves I have always said this. They are both media darlings with a great history. Yet, they crush it every regular season and fizzle in the playoffs. 
	Arturo Bugarin they just have a lot of great competition so they will have to be on their A game or go home
	Celtics vs Lakers 
	How does this affect Ja Morant legacy
	Nice 1 Boston Celtics 👏🏻
	How does this concern Denver
	How does this affect Nuggets legacy
	Mathers Prince the Nuggets don’t have a legacy.
	Mike Crandall and Boston legacy is useless championships when they were 8 teams in the league
	🤡 comment.  There’s your legacy.
	❤️❤️❤️
	How does this affect Joker's legacy
	‼️BOUND TO GET UPSET BY ONE OF THE PLAYOFF BOTTOM TEAMS. PROBABLY CAVS OR MAGIC. PHILA WILL COME OUT TO THE EAST. Witness History #PHILACHAMPS 🏆
	It's always been Brown &gt; Tatum. Still is
	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
	This TEAM IS READY TO MAKE A GOOD AND SOLID RUN AT THE TITTLE.   JT AND JB  ARE WELL EXPERIENCE   NOT A LOSING STREAK ALL YEAR   MOST CONSISTENT TEAM IN THE NBA. BEST OFFENSE ALONG WITH THE SECOND BEST DEFENSE the Bench has  a 5.8 net rating second to none.  Boy this Cs are equipped. Let’s get it.
	2023-2024 NBA world champion The golden states Warriors FMVP King Jonathan kuminga Mark my word!!
	They guaranteed the number 1 seed??? I don't get it?
	Keijo Kaljo they could lose every game they have left and still have the best record in the NBA
	Iceberg Dee that's exactly my point...
	Keijo Kaljo so what don't you get?
	Keijo Kaljo yeah what don’t you get?
	Carl Stunna why they struggling against a bottom feeder with most of their starters...rest em...try and win the chip
	Keijo Kaljo who did they struggle against did you see the score or just yapping?
	Keijo Kaljo we already clinched number 1
	Keith Allen that's what I'm saying...why struggle early April to beat some bottom feeders??? Keep the players fresh and try make a run finally
	Keith Allen they've won 1 title in 40 years...it's about time
	That's cool and all but what does this have to do with Thanasis Antetokounmpo NBA legacy.
	How does this affect Curry legacy
	Portland
	Lets see in play off boston
	How does this concern Joker
	🍀
	😘
	All-Star All-NBA JB has shut down all contract critics with his play this season! 💪🏽The Mighty Celtics have to much FIREPOWER for teams to deal with! 💥 
	Isaiah 55:11
	Crazy to me how this mid player finessed himself such a insane contract
	Jason Espinoza bro mid level? nah. I'm born and raised in mass and even I'll admit he ain't worth 304 Ms but still...he ain't mid bro.
	Drew Everett 23ppg 3apg 5rpg. He's a borderline all star. I guess I can change that title of mid to above average. Sure doesn't pass the eye test, can't dribble well and was pathetic in dunk contest lol
	Jason Espinoza I agree with all that. EMBARRASSING dunk contest and his left hand is non existent
	But they can't win a chip
	I’m paying 5 grands to first the 7 people to message me with “GOD IS GOOD “ let’s spread love and stay blessed y’all
