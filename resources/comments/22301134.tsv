	Nothing like the salt from all the low level fans whose teams are so bad they have nothing to talk about but their hate for the Celtics. 😁☘️
	" Nothing like  Celtics fans thinking they are Relevant when they can't get to the mountain top and keep failing... Portland fans have no expectations so when The Blazers fail they don't get upset Boston fans have high expectations and wi… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	
	 Don't need a tissue I am not fan of either team I am stating reality...
	
	 isn’t it just a bit ironic from a cowboys fan?
	 foreign fan boyz only know of the Flakers, Dead Dynasty Warriors, and the Regular season champs, the Celtics who will fold in the playoffs
	 Nobody takes anything serious from folks in colorado who became nuggets fans the previous year 🤣
	 tee hee hee 🤡 nobody takes these foreign fan boyz who crack themselves up seriously. They are more interested in pop-culture than good basketball 🏀 
	This team. Going to have 18 banner this 2024! 💚🍀
	It so easy for Boston, they should create a new league for TOP teams as we
	 go follow the warriors or lakers or even better stick to the Pino league
	Boston is looking for a championship. Holla at your boy !
	Went to that game
	They gonna choke in the playoffs
	 get a life
	 you mad? 🤣🤣🤣
	 go play in traffic blindfolded old fart
	 you too easy troll.lol
	 I’m a Celtics fan and I believe this too 😂
	 I hope so
	 as usual 😂😂😂
	 just like you choke on dicks...

	Nothing like the salt from all the low level fans whose teams are so bad they have nothing to talk about but their hate for the Celtics. 😁☘️
	I'm starting to think that the Blazers won't make the playoffs this season
	Let's Go Celtics ☘️
	Celtics goin crazy this year
	 until the playoffs
	 they like the cowboys of the nba
	 I have always said this. They are both media darlings with a great history. Yet, they crush it every regular season and fizzle in the playoffs. 
	 they just have a lot of great competition so they will have to be on their A game or go home
	Celtics/Thunder Finals
	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪
	How does this concern Denver
	How does this affect Ja Morant legacy
	Celtics vs Lakers 
	 you are absolutely not allowed to like both that's like saying you like both the Red Sox and the Yankees the Cowboys and 49ers the Giants and the Dodgers big no no
	 you’re not a real fan of either
	Nice 1 Boston Celtics 👏🏻
	How does this affect Nuggets legacy
	 too stupid to know the difference between affect and effect are we? Stay in school
	 the Nuggets don’t have a legacy.
	 and Boston legacy is useless championships when they were 8 teams in the league
	 you made a nice 🤡 comment.  There’s your legacy.
	❤️❤️❤️
	a, Celtics yan. Banner 18 coming. Prepared na sila talaga.
	How does this affect Joker's legacy
	‼️BOUND TO GET UPSET BY ONE OF THE PLAYOFF BOTTOM TEAMS. PROBABLY CAVS OR MAGIC. PHILA WILL COME OUT TO THE EAST. Witness History <a class=

	It's always been Brown &gt; Tatum. Still is
	 😕😕😕😕
	 nah... Isnt there a scam you should be running Prince?

	2023-2024 NBA world champion The golden states Warriors FMVP King Jonathan kuminga Mark my word!!
	 ladyboys would do anything to have Steph shoot in them
	 delussional gsw fan🤣
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Boston Celtics
	They guaranteed the number 1 seed??? I don't get it?
	 we already clinched number 1
	 that's what I'm saying...why struggle early April to beat some bottom feeders??? Keep the players fresh and try make a run finally
	 they've won 1 title in 40 years...it's about time
	 they could lose every game they have left and still have the best record in the NBA
	 that's exactly my point...
	 so what don't you get?
	 yeah what don’t you get?
	 why they struggling against a bottom feeder with most of their starters...rest em...try and win the chip
	 who did they struggle against did you see the score or just yapping?
	for the NBA All Team, maybe!
	That's cool and all but what does this have to do with Thanasis Antetokounmpo NBA legacy.
	Northwest hills jeep

	All-Star All-NBA JB has shut down all contract critics with his play this season! 💪🏽The Mighty Celtics have to much FIREPOWER for teams to deal with! 💥 
	Ballers
	Isaiah 55:11
	Crazy to me how this mid player finessed himself such a insane contract
	 bro mid level? nah. I'm born and raised in mass and even I'll admit he ain't worth 304 Ms but still...he ain't mid bro.
	 23ppg 3apg 5rpg. He's a borderline all star. I guess I can change that title of mid to above average. Sure doesn't pass the eye test, can't dribble well and was pathetic in dunk contest lol
	 I agree with all that. EMBARRASSING dunk contest and his left hand is non existent
	 eye test doesn’t mean much if you’re blind bro 🤷🏻‍♂️
	But they can't win a chip
	I’m paying 5 grands to first the 7 people to message me with “GOD IS GOOD “ let’s spread love and stay blessed y’all
