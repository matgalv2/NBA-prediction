	Scott Foster is the only winner of this game, he needs to be fired!
	"Scott Foster says ""you're welcome.""  He'll stop by later to pick up his cut.  The refs calling his game really wanted Cleveland to win."
	Go Cavs!!
	Scott Foster won the game!
	Thank you Cleveland from an OKC fan lol
	😄
	It’s disappointing when horrific calls take away the honesty of the game, it’s more disappointing when the NBA ignores events and punishes players who legitimately deserve to condemn the conduct of those who are privileged to support and make the game more enjoyable and honest, win or loose the NBA is apparently choosing ignorance… it’s disappointing when a ref or refs dictate outcomes, it’s more disgusting to find out the NBA is allowing and condoning such deliberate behaviors towards teams.
	maybe cleveland is the eastern conference champion soon. 😏
	Aaron Giffin
	MVP of game is definitely Scott Foster. Lol
	Jarrett Allen has always been the key.. every good team in the NBA has their big man touch the ball every time down the court and it works.. when JA is involved his activity level peaks on offense, defense and rebounding.. then everyone else clicks..!! JA is the key..!
	Beat the Celtics and T-Wolves in the same week with depleted roster 🔥
	He should've been an all star
	Sho Nuff number 1 flopper! He’s got it!
	Jimbo Wally no that's leflop

	"Ant was 7-27 shots for 19 points including 0-7 on 3 point fg in 42 minutes of play  can people just stop mentioning him as a Mvp candidate  one great block doesn't make him ""The Man"" Jokic is the MAN"
	And Donovan Mitchell didn't even play.
