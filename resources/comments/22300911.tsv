TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Scott Foster is the only winner of this game, he needs to be fired!
	"Scott Foster says ""you're welcome.""  He'll stop by later to pick up his cut.  The refs calling his game really wanted Cleveland to win."
CLE	Go Cavs!!
	Scott Foster won the game!
CLE	Thank you Cleveland from an OKC fan lol
CLE	😄
	It’s disappointing when horrific calls take away the honesty of the game, it’s more disappointing when the NBA ignores events and punishes players who legitimately deserve to condemn the conduct of those who are privileged to support and make the game more enjoyable and honest, win or loose the NBA is apparently choosing ignorance… it’s disappointing when a ref or refs dictate outcomes, it’s more disgusting to find out the NBA is allowing and condoning such deliberate behaviors towards teams.
CLE	maybe cleveland is the eastern conference champion soon. 😏
	Aaron Giffin
	MVP of game is definitely Scott Foster. Lol
CLE	Jarrett Allen has always been the key.. every good team in the NBA has their big man touch the ball every time down the court and it works.. when JA is involved his activity level peaks on offense, defense and rebounding.. then everyone else clicks..!! JA is the key..!
CLE	Beat the Celtics and T-Wolves in the same week with depleted roster 🔥

CLE	Sho Nuff number 1 flopper! He’s got it!

CLE	And Donovan Mitchell didn't even play.
