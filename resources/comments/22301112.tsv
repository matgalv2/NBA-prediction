	Josh Hart was the hero this game 31-9-8  74 FG%￼
	The refs in this game were absolutely unfair to the kings!
	Good game.. Good victory.. Playoffs will be a tough without maybe 2 starters
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	I strongly believe the Knicks will be dangerous comes playoff.
	I love how they all play with heart we just need OG and will be good enough cause Randle is def out 🙏🏽
	Great predic knicks east finals vs celtics. Great predic
	Brunson will continue to get lots of assists if Hart keeps driving to the basket after they double Brunson
	Thank you Knicks from Lakers nation.
	Brunson my man! Wish he still played for Dallas.
	32 point turnaround huge win knicks are the real deal.
	I saw skeptical at first but I think he’s shaping into something special tbh. 
	Appreciate it! from the LakeShow
	Thanks Los Angeles Knicks. Btw these are the Kings next games: Celtics,Nets,Thunder,Pelicans,Suns and Trail Blazers. Tuff
	Knicks proved tonight, that they have the Potencial.  I’m proud of you guys Do it again👏👏👏
	On behalf of Lakeshow thanks Knicks!
	Great win we needed that
	Tough loss for the kings, tomorrow will face boston.
	Rigged Fork Sacramento not to get in the playoffs rewrite the script NBA treat my city with the proper respect
	as a Lakers fan, Thank you NY Knicks 😂
	Jalen Brunson is a star
	Seems like the Celtics have a better team
	💪💪💪💪
	If and only Josh Hart could play like this,NY will be tough to beat
	Great win

	ill never understand the calls he gets.    telling me fox couldnt get any of those same calls?
	made 2 more fts than the entire other team
	Thank you so much nicks and Boston advance 😘
	I hope this is our year . So much psd since the 90s 🙏 don't Wana get too exited
	thank gosh he was big in 2nd half!
	All Brunson does is rush the goal begging for a light foul. Just throws his head back every single time to get one and the refs hand it to him 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
	But…..of course!!!!! ❤️
