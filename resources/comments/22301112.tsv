TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
NYK	Josh Hart was the hero this game 31-9-8  74 FG%￼
SAC	The refs in this game were absolutely unfair to the kings!
NYK	Good game.. Good victory.. Playoffs will be a tough without maybe 2 starters
NYK	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
NYK	I strongly believe the Knicks will be dangerous comes playoff.
NYK	I love how they all play with heart we just need OG and will be good enough cause Randle is def out 🙏🏽
NYK	Great predic knicks east finals vs celtics. Great predic
NYK	Brunson will continue to get lots of assists if Hart keeps driving to the basket after they double Brunson
NYK	Brunson my man! Wish he still played for Dallas.
NYK	32 point turnaround huge win knicks are the real deal.
