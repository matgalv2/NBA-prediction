	Lakers will be the champion.
	Dallas threw this game like kid didn't care to win and rested his star players
	What a major win for the Piston.
	,Not really! They were not playing the starters!  They are resting, for The Clippers!  Mavericks gave them the game, because it mean nothing!
	 Who says it means nothing? Ask Miriam Adelson and Sivan and Patrick Dumont, players as well.
	 ,Is Detroit in the playoffs?  The answer should tell you the truth!
	 are you sure about the next day what is gonna happen!
	I’m sure both Purdue and UConn will sweep the Pistons in a 7-game series 😤😩😭💀🤣
	Great job Detroit... Make that push for playoffs 😀
	I don't understand why Dallas threw this game and rested their guys. They're playing the Clippers 1st round no matter what, but why not fight for home court advantage?
	Dallas sitting everyone vs OKC as well. Helping okc secure the 1-seed. Hopefully we beat clippers round 1 and rather play okc than Denver in round 2.
	Marcus Sasser Jr. lifts the Detroit Pistons to a win in Dallas with Luka and Kyrie taking the night off and the C-team getting all the minutes. Fixed it for you.
	Heat vs Lakers in the Finals
	I mean we clearly let ‘em have it they already sorry as is might as well let them win a game out of respect rest the all stars til the big battle comes during playoffs it’s still  over here
	Kind of like arm wrestling your dad when you’re a little kid 😂
	Without Luka and Kyrie.
	None of our starters played lol 😂
	Vegas won big tonight…and so few other games
	Been waiting for the smashing of the 70-inch TV screen comment.
	The perfect season is coming to an end
	No luka &amp; kyrie  Can't win?
	Dropping to the 14 win Pistons this late when you could have 51 wins is not good
	HUGE WIN FOR DETROIT! THEY ARE PLAYOFF READY! ❤️
	People pay to watch Irving and Luca and yet  both did not play.
	I would say we be messing up are draft position but obviously that doesn't matter, Hell probably will help us out in the long run.
	Go for the 15th win Pistons!
	Congratulations piston for your new home 🏡 and your beautiful 🤩 and your new baby
	So Dallas will give up next vs okc also?
	Yow ishowspeed
	How did they managed to beat the Mavericks in Dallas?? Unbelievable!!
	This is Jeryl Sasser’s nephew if y’all didn’t know
	As a millionaire living my best life, I’m 5 grand  to the first 5 people who message me ‘GRACE’. It’s all about sharing the blessings. Stay bless y’all!
	 Paul george and James harden need to get this kid ASAP😂
	As a millionaire who is living his best life.

	LeBron &amp;The Lakers will be the Champions
	Go Pistons! This is our year!!!
	They should just sit teams out who aren’t gonna make the playoffs, just adding more losses to their records, 67 yikes
	The Nuggets didn't get the most embarrassing loss tonight,  it seems.
	Marcus Sasser where you at
	Idk tat
