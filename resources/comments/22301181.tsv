TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Lakers will be the champion.
DAL	Dallas threw this game like kid didn't care to win and rested his star players
DET	What a major win for the Piston.
DET	Pinoy memes,Not really! They were not playing the starters!  They are resting, for The Clippers!  Mavericks gave them the game, because it mean nothing!
	Katrina Louise Walker Who says it means nothing? Ask Miriam Adelson and Sivan and Patrick Dumont, players as well.
DET	Pinoy memes ,Is Detroit in the playoffs?  The answer should tell you the truth!
	Aljoša Skledar are you sure about the next day what is gonna happen!
	I’m sure both Purdue and UConn will sweep the Pistons in a 7-game series 😤😩😭💀🤣
DAL	I don't understand why Dallas threw this game and rested their guys. They're playing the Clippers 1st round no matter what, but why not fight for home court advantage?
DET	Great job Detroit... Make that push for playoffs 😀
DAL	Dallas sitting everyone vs OKC as well. Helping okc secure the 1-seed. Hopefully we beat clippers round 1 and rather play okc than Denver in round 2.
DET	Marcus Sasser Jr. lifts the Detroit Pistons to a win in Dallas with Luka and Kyrie taking the night off and the C-team getting all the minutes. Fixed it for you.
	Andrew Nelson Isn’t it sad that Powell is a member of that C-team now? He still looked like a fool out there.
	Heat vs Lakers in the Finals
	I mean we clearly let ‘em have it they already sorry as is might as well let them win a game out of respect rest the all stars til the big battle comes during playoffs it’s still #MFFL over here
	Kind of like arm wrestling your dad when you’re a little kid 😂
DAL	Without Luka and Kyrie.
	Martin Ljungmann that is a poor mindset, all players need to step up mostly if their star player cannot play!
	💪
DAL	Martin Ljungmann yeah Dallas loss on purpose they don't need to win anymore games they know who they are playing
	Vegas won big tonight…and so few other games
DAL	None of our starters played lol 😂
DAL	No luka &amp; kyrie  Can't win?
	Been waiting for the smashing of the 70-inch TV screen comment.
	The perfect season is coming to an end
DAL	Dropping to the 14 win Pistons this late when you could have 51 wins is not good
DET	HUGE WIN FOR DETROIT! THEY ARE PLAYOFF READY! ❤️
DAL	People pay to watch Irving and Luca and yet  both did not play.
	I would say we be messing up are draft position but obviously that doesn't matter, Hell probably will help us out in the long run.
	Riley Machleit hello friend
DET	Go for the 15th win Pistons!
DET	Congratulations piston for your new home 🏡 and your beautiful 🤩 and your new baby
	Yow ishowspeed
	So Dallas will give up next vs okc also?
	This is Jeryl Sasser’s nephew if y’all didn’t know
DET	How did they managed to beat the Mavericks in Dallas?? Unbelievable!!
	Barry Lester 
	Lawrence: Yeah, they're playing the Clippers no matter what, so guess they figured might as well rest.
DAL	Lawrence: Luka &amp; Kyrie didn't play.
	As a millionaire living my best life, I’m 5 grand  to the first 5 people who message me ‘GRACE’. It’s all about sharing the blessings. Stay bless y’all!

	LeBron &amp;The Lakers will be the Champions
DET	Go Pistons! This is our year!!!
	They should just sit teams out who aren’t gonna make the playoffs, just adding more losses to their records, 67 yikes
	The Nuggets didn't get the most embarrassing loss tonight,  it seems.
	Marcus Sasser where you at
	Idk tat
