	I really love how his game elevated!! I’m glad he’s not just known as one of the best dunkers.
	Gordon helps nuggets to won a championship..
	My Nuggets are ready for Championship #2.
	Love his game,  I don’t why more teams did not go after him  harder.
	Congratulation, the best basketball player, go ahead, best wishes.
	AG is amazing!
	Run it back! Go Nuggets!!
	I'm so glad the Nuggets are doing great I just wish I could watch the games but they are always blacked out
	 My sentiments exactly. They make so much money they could let us watch every game.
	 exactly
	Best time for Jokic and Murray to rest. Against a rookie line up. Great coaching
	It will be Denver vs Boston in the championship
	"The Nuggets have 4 guys that are All-Star caliber players. You don’t see it most games because there’s only 48 minutes, one basketball and each of them buys into their role. But last night with Murray and Jokic out, Aaron Gordon had an opportunity to p… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	I like watching him vs. the Lakers as he is able to play well vs . LBJ and AD and competing at a high level in those difficult match up.Denver’s Swiss army knife kind of player.
	He is one of our main boys, maybe the best trade in Nuggets history, and he will forever be remembered as a Nugget, Orlando was just a stepping stone for him!
	THAT’s our” MITTY BOY “great job Mr. Gordon.
	Hmm, as a 40 yr Warriors fan,🫤🥺☹️ it may be time to trade Steph for several 1st round picks.  The Warriors are going no where.  They’re not even going to make the playoffs.  Congrats Houston, you deserve it.
	They played 5 Portland rookie lineup,  and won by three.
	Gordon  the past two years was an all star
	Denver plucked orlandos best player at the time and nobody even mentioned it.
	 The nuggets is a stack team but people act like their success is all jokic Murray MPJ and Aaron Gordon are all capable of being 1st options
	I love the way AG plays ball. So much fun to watch him
	Hes a stud...proubably why they are doing so well
	Edit: he didn't play. Thanks Joshua 
	He held it down as our 5 in a pinch, but we need something more sustainable.
	Serious title contenders
	must be a joke from 13pts game to a 2 point game at the end within a minute
	"  Due to Murray and Jokic being out with injuries, we effectively played our bench the whole game, and they held down the fort. Remember, Denver had to shed a lot of depth after our championship last year (or as I like to call it, the ""champs tax"", ugh), and so some of these guys are new. It wasn't pretty, but it shows that we can depend on our bench to win games. We can afford a loss or two right now, but what we can't afford is more injuries. The Nuggets will probably be quite conservative these next few games for that reason."
	 and you talked like Portland are with super full strength?!
	 I heard about their starters being out too. Effectively, it was like watching a preseason game. The NBA has momentum swings, even teams with backups can go on a 11 point run.
	 but nuggets were having KCP AG MPJ and RJ to close the game. It shouldn't be hard at all with these 4. 
	Aaron Gordon is 6'10 with bulky body, good player
	Congrats Denver Nuggets..
	AG is amazing!
	He has to be
