TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I really love how his game elevated!! I’m glad he’s not just known as one of the best dunkers.
	Gordon helps nuggets to won a championship..
	Love his game,  I don’t why more teams did not go after him  harder.
	My Nuggets are ready for Championship #2.
	Congratulation, the best basketball player, go ahead, best wishes.
	Run it back! Go Nuggets!!
	I'm so glad the Nuggets are doing great I just wish I could watch the games but they are always blacked out
	AG is amazing!
	Best time for Jokic and Murray to rest. Against a rookie line up. Great coaching
	The Nuggets have 4 guys that are All-Star caliber players. You don’t see it most games because there’s only 48 minutes, one basketball and each of them buys into their role. But last night with Murray and Jokic out, Aaron Gordon had an opportunity to prove what he could do as the number 1 option on a team and he did not disappoint!
	It will be Denver vs Boston in the championship
	He is one of our main boys, maybe the best trade in Nuggets history, and he will forever be remembered as a Nugget, Orlando was just a stepping stone for him!
	THAT’s our” MITTY BOY “great job Mr. Gordon.
	I like watching him vs. the Lakers as he is able to play well vs . LBJ and AD and competing at a high level in those difficult match up.Denver’s Swiss army knife kind of player.
	They played 5 Portland rookie lineup,  and won by three.
	Hmm, as a 40 yr Warriors fan,🫤🥺☹️ it may be time to trade Steph for several 1st round picks.  The Warriors are going no where.  They’re not even going to make the playoffs.  Congrats Houston, you deserve it.
	Gordon  the past two years was an all star
	Denver plucked orlandos best player at the time and nobody even mentioned it.
	I love the way AG plays ball. So much fun to watch him
	Hes a stud...proubably why they are doing so well
	Edit: he didn't play. Thanks Joshua 
	Chris Paynter no he sat with back tightness
	Joshua Zeigler ok thanks
	Chris Paynter Murray didn't play either... Ankle ... This was load management without calling it load management lol
	Joshua Zeigler fair enough
	Joshua Zeigler cheers
	👋 how are you doing
	Chris Paynter no even murray
	He held it down as our 5 in a pinch, but we need something more sustainable.
	AG is amazing!
	Serious title contenders
	must be a joke from 13pts game to a 2 point game at the end within a minute
	"Teri Nash Cheung Dave Curry Due to Murray and Jokic being out with injuries, we effectively played our bench the whole game, and they held down the fort. Remember, Denver had to shed a lot of depth after our championship last year (or as I like to call it, the ""champs tax"", ugh), and so some of these guys are new. It wasn't pretty, but it shows that we can depend on our bench to win games. We can afford a loss or two right now, but what we can't afford is more injuries. The Nuggets will probably be quite conservative these next few games for that reason."
	Zacho Gilman and you talked like Portland are with super full strength?!
	Teri Nash Cheung I heard about their starters being out too. Effectively, it was like watching a preseason game. The NBA has momentum swings, even teams with backups can go on a 11 point run.
	Zacho Gilman but nuggets were having KCP AG MPJ and RJ to close the game. It shouldn't be hard at all with these 4. 
	Aaron Gordon is 6'10 with bulky body, good player
	He has to be
	Congrats Denver Nuggets..
	Doing it ALL 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
	My favorite player

	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
	Man of the people... dude deserves a statue more than any other Denver sport icon. Gordon is him.
	Aron Gordon is a hell of a player . Love watching him and Nikolich .￼
	Denver Nuggets Vs Portland Trail Blazers

	How come he isn't considered MVP? Mpj, Jamal..
