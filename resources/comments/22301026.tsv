TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DEN	I really love how his game elevated!! I’m glad he’s not just known as one of the best dunkers.
DEN	Gordon helps nuggets to won a championship..
DEN	Love his game,  I don’t why more teams did not go after him  harder.
DEN	My Nuggets are ready for Championship #2.
DEN	Congratulation, the best basketball player, go ahead, best wishes.
DEN	Run it back! Go Nuggets!!
DEN	I'm so glad the Nuggets are doing great I just wish I could watch the games but they are always blacked out
DEN	AG is amazing!
DEN	Best time for Jokic and Murray to rest. Against a rookie line up. Great coaching
DEN	The Nuggets have 4 guys that are All-Star caliber players. You don’t see it most games because there’s only 48 minutes, one basketball and each of them buys into their role. But last night with Murray and Jokic out, Aaron Gordon had an opportunity to prove what he could do as the number 1 option on a team and he did not disappoint!
DEN	It will be Denver vs Boston in the championship
DEN	He is one of our main boys, maybe the best trade in Nuggets history, and he will forever be remembered as a Nugget, Orlando was just a stepping stone for him!
DEN	THAT’s our” MITTY BOY “great job Mr. Gordon.
DEN	I like watching him vs. the Lakers as he is able to play well vs . LBJ and AD and competing at a high level in those difficult match up.Denver’s Swiss army knife kind of player.
DEN	They played 5 Portland rookie lineup,  and won by three.
	Hmm, as a 40 yr Warriors fan,🫤🥺☹️ it may be time to trade Steph for several 1st round picks.  The Warriors are going no where.  They’re not even going to make the playoffs.  Congrats Houston, you deserve it.
DEN	Gordon  the past two years was an all star
DEN	Denver plucked orlandos best player at the time and nobody even mentioned it.
DEN	I love the way AG plays ball. So much fun to watch him
DEN	Hes a stud...proubably why they are doing so well
DEN	Edit: he didn't play. Thanks Joshua
DEN	Chris Paynter no he sat with back tightness
DEN	Joshua Zeigler ok thanks
DEN	Chris Paynter Murray didn't play either... Ankle ... This was load management without calling it load management lol
DEN	Joshua Zeigler fair enough
DEN	Joshua Zeigler cheers
	👋 how are you doing
DEN	Chris Paynter no even murray
DEN	He held it down as our 5 in a pinch, but we need something more sustainable.
DEN	AG is amazing!
DEN	Serious title contenders
DEN	must be a joke from 13pts game to a 2 point game at the end within a minute
DEN	"Teri Nash Cheung Dave Curry Due to Murray and Jokic being out with injuries, we effectively played our bench the whole game, and they held down the fort. Remember, Denver had to shed a lot of depth after our championship last year (or as I like to call it, the ""champs tax"", ugh), and so some of these guys are new. It wasn't pretty, but it shows that we can depend on our bench to win games. We can afford a loss or two right now, but what we can't afford is more injuries. The Nuggets will probably be quite conservative these next few games for that reason."
POR	Zacho Gilman and you talked like Portland are with super full strength?!
DEN	Teri Nash Cheung I heard about their starters being out too. Effectively, it was like watching a preseason game. The NBA has momentum swings, even teams with backups can go on a 11 point run.
DEN	Zacho Gilman but nuggets were having KCP AG MPJ and RJ to close the game. It shouldn't be hard at all with these 4.
DEN	Aaron Gordon is 6'10 with bulky body, good player
DEN	He has to be
DEN	Congrats Denver Nuggets..
DEN	Doing it ALL 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
DEN	My favorite player

POR	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
DEN	Man of the people... dude deserves a statue more than any other Denver sport icon. Gordon is him.
DEN	Aron Gordon is a hell of a player . Love watching him and Nikolich .
	Denver Nuggets Vs Portland Trail Blazers
