	Watching Ant is like watching MJ's highlights from the 90s.  He is so smooth and so graceful.  He doesn't rush anything. He just lets the game come to him.
	Ridiculous. He find it hard to score when Kawhi was on him in the 1stQ. Then Kawhi suddenly went missing, never played from 2Q-4th due to thoracic spasm--- no one played defense anymore, Anthony saw the opportunity and took advantage of the situation. <a tabindex=😳.
	 your a true 🤡 🤣🤣 Leanord wasn’t stopping nobody while in the game get off his S&amp;ck 🤣🤣🤡🤡
	
	Can't even beat LeBron lol he respected his domination
	 Edwards the next MJ.
	 what seed are you lakers fans again I forgot 🤔
	No such thing as healthy Kawhi and Clippers come playoff time!
	 they shouldn't need kawhi if George would do his job.  Harden did absolutely nothing as well. Pathetic play from some Hof players smh
	 klipers are laos na hahaha
	 always excuses 😂😂 ya had PG out there he plays defense too
	i'm not making excuses, i'm a Laker! lol
	 broke down kawhi still has 2 rings 2 fmvps 2 dpoy awards.
	Playoff nlng paguusapan sa clippers, wla e di kayang talunin ang MIN. Kainis nmn big lead end up lose!
	I'm not sold on him as of yet.  Who on the Lakers could guard him? Big game , time to shine and yet looked pretty normal. Leonard gets hurt ,then he picks up the scoring, I'm just not sure about him.
	It’s more so how terrible the clippers are than how “good” Minnesota is lmao. That was possibly some of the worst basketball I’ve seen played in the last few decades. Absolutely disgraceful by LA. If I’m Lue, I’m thinking about making cuts and going for a full rebuild. This is not going to work at all.
	 facts
	 oh wolves so bad maintaining 1st in the west 95% of the season you sound ignorant af
	Edwards is future super star
	My Clippers are a joke right now
	Ivan Sanchez Orbe when was the time they were never a joke 🤣😂
	 Now?  
	Clippers should of won that game
	 and they didn't
	  it wasn't close lol
	 should have they sold 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 yep Wolves barely edged them by 18.
	Once again, Vimbanyamama is dominating the rookie stats, where do you think his ceiling is?
	Lisngag man kaayo ug ilong edward bai 😅
	PG got clamped, ripped and scored on all in one sequence 👏🏽…
	James 'ayaw tumira' Harden

	Lmao flippers here we go with the injury’s I keep telling people the basement team is a good regular season team they 🗑️ come playoff time 😂
	Clippees without Leonard are the Detroit Pistons
	🐺showing out…down KAT and they fight through.  Ant, NAW and Minnesota Mike throwing haymakers. Hell of a game.
	Paul George sorry ass only scored 2 points in the 4 quarter
	He aint crying now on free throws since they won. If they lost this game will he be crying on 25 ft by clips to 14 on them? hahaha.
	 dude literally laughing at his own joke
	Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Way to go Ant! Also huge game from Naw and Mike Conley!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
	The clippers suck and Leonard always disappoints in the end
	Race is peace Gerardo mark my words 😂😭
	Anthony Edwards being a wolf
	He’s the man🙄
	Ma swerti parin Ang Minnesota ksi wla si kawhi Kung Hindi pikon nanaman si Edward ksi talo sana
	Ant has to be in MVP discussions by now, yeah?
	 I only see that happening is if the wolves win the west.
