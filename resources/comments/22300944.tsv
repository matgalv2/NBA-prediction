TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Watching Ant is like watching MJ's highlights from the 90s.  He is so smooth and so graceful.  He doesn't rush anything. He just lets the game come to him.
	Ridiculous. He find it hard to score when Kawhi was on him in the 1stQ. Then Kawhi suddenly went missing, never played from 2Q-4th due to thoracic spasm--- no one played defense anymore, Anthony saw the opportunity and took advantage of the situation. Funny how TLue managed their lead. It only lasted 5min in the 2nd Q and he just don't care. Only called a timeout after the lead went down to 4pts 🤯😳.
	Mhaze Gacilos 
	🤡 🤣🤣 Leanord wasn’t stopping nobody while in the game get off his S&amp;ck 🤣🤣🤡🤡
	Christian J Evans
	Can't even beat LeBron lol he respected his domination
	Ethan Astrologo Edwards the next MJ.
	🤔
	No such thing as healthy Kawhi and Clippers come playoff time!
	Mel Yonaryo they shouldn't need kawhi if George would do his job.  Harden did absolutely nothing as well. Pathetic play from some Hof players smh
	Mel Yonaryo klipers are laos na hahaha
	😂😂 ya had PG out there he plays defense too
	i'm not making excuses, i'm a Laker! lol
	Mel Yonaryo broke down kawhi still has 2 rings 2 fmvps 2 dpoy awards.
	Playoff nlng paguusapan sa clippers, wla e di kayang talunin ang MIN. Kainis nmn big lead end up lose!
	I'm not sold on him as of yet.  Who on the Lakers could guard him? Big game , time to shine and yet looked pretty normal. Leonard gets hurt ,then he picks up the scoring, I'm just not sure about him.
	It’s more so how terrible the clippers are than how “good” Minnesota is lmao. That was possibly some of the worst basketball I’ve seen played in the last few decades. Absolutely disgraceful by LA. If I’m Lue, I’m thinking about making cuts and going for a full rebuild. This is not going to work at all.
