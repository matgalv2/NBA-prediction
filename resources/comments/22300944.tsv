TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
MIN	Watching Ant is like watching MJ's highlights from the 90s.  He is so smooth and so graceful.  He doesn't rush anything. He just lets the game come to him.
MIN	Ridiculous. He find it hard to score when Kawhi was on him in the 1stQ. Then Kawhi suddenly went missing, never played from 2Q-4th due to thoracic spasm--- no one played defense anymore, Anthony saw the opportunity and took advantage of the situation. Funny how TLue managed their lead. It only lasted 5min in the 2nd Q and he just don't care. Only called a timeout after the lead went down to 4pts 🤯😳.
	Mhaze Gacilos 
MIN	🤡 🤣🤣 Leanord wasn’t stopping nobody while in the game get off his S&amp;ck 🤣🤣🤡🤡
	Christian J Evans
	Can't even beat LeBron lol he respected his domination
MIN	Ethan Astrologo Edwards the next MJ.
	🤔
LAC	No such thing as healthy Kawhi and Clippers come playoff time!
LAC	Mel Yonaryo they shouldn't need kawhi if George would do his job.  Harden did absolutely nothing as well. Pathetic play from some Hof players smh
LAC	Mel Yonaryo klipers are laos na hahaha
LAC	😂😂 ya had PG out there he plays defense too
	i'm not making excuses, i'm a Laker! lol
LAC	Mel Yonaryo broke down kawhi still has 2 rings 2 fmvps 2 dpoy awards.
LAC	Playoff nlng paguusapan sa clippers, wla e di kayang talunin ang MIN. Kainis nmn big lead end up lose!
LAC	I'm not sold on him as of yet.  Who on the Lakers could guard him? Big game , time to shine and yet looked pretty normal. Leonard gets hurt ,then he picks up the scoring, I'm just not sure about him.
LAC	It’s more so how terrible the clippers are than how “good” Minnesota is lmao. That was possibly some of the worst basketball I’ve seen played in the last few decades. Absolutely disgraceful by LA. If I’m Lue, I’m thinking about making cuts and going for a full rebuild. This is not going to work at all.
LAC	Vito TwoFederal facts
MIN	Vito TwoFederal oh wolves so bad maintaining 1st in the west 95% of the season you sound ignorant af

LAC	🐺showing out…down KAT and they fight through.  Ant, NAW and Minnesota Mike throwing haymakers. Hell of a game.
LAC	Paul George sorry ass only scored 2 points in the 4 quarter
