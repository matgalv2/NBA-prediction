	Kyrie and Luka magic! The real deal!
	This is a different team. This kind of games are used to be out of hand when their 3s aren't going in, but now they answer with defensive stops and physicality, they just never give up. We're playoff ready man.
	"Two absolutely MASSIVE wins against the Kings this week.  Tied up the season series and gave Dallas a two game cushion.  Exum missed a few down the stretch but they kept coming back to him and he finally delivered what would be the dagger 3.  I love th… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	  the trades helped our defense and rebounding. We will be a scary out!
	 Dallas is dangerous this season
	Dallas teammates’s trust on exum in those clutch situation is better than my wife’s trust on me
	 HAHAHAHA
	 hayp ka bro. 🤣🤣
	 Lo q te dije 🤣
	 bueno Irving lo marcan y luka lo marcan la lógica dice que se la pases al otro tipo que esta solo y cobra millones de dolares
	" por eso Denver es Denver no todo es Murray y Joker,si no le das la confianza para esos momentos en playoff tu pretendes que tengan la confianza de tan siquiera intentarlo? Se la va a pasar a luka y Irving y en muchas ocasiones ti… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 Tú eres Playmaker y yo Juancho 🤣👌
	 no eso es mucho eres el Cowboy NBA🤣
	For football tips
	They are playing good, but I don’t see them beating teams like OKC. They would sweep them for sure!
	Mavs 10-1 in the last 11 games, only game they lost was when Luka sat. They are the scariest team in the west outside of Denver
	 total difference from last year
	 sure
	 idk mavs are starting to look more
	 first round exit
	 the team they play next is dangerous and on a 10 game winning streak. Houston Rockets
	 As a team they're starting to show the same chemistry as the 2011 team.
	 Denver overrated without bruce brown getting was their heart
	 honestly
	thank you dallas, lakeshow top 6 continues 🔥
	Yeah!!! Let's get it!! Mavs on fire 🔥💯🔥🤗🤗
	Sacramento bout to join the Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Rockets in the intense battle for the 10th seed! 😤😩😭💀🤣
	Kidd was finally doing what is right , get THJ out and the other dudes if there shooting slump. Sub em with a more confident player and not a liability in defense . Good job MAVS 💙
	 and calling timeouts when the game was getting a bit erratic.
	Exum missing two open 3s and a layup, then draining that dagger 3. Sheeesh 
	I guess Kyrie’S found another great team and team mates
	Those defensive stops in the last few minutes of the game is like a foresight of things to come in the playoffs... Great win for the Mavs, although, I almost had a heart attack everytime the Kings score.
	 Same here
	Can't believe kyrie isn't top 75 yeah he has his personal issues but he's an insane ball player.
	 he has the fault of saying what he thinks in a world of sheeps with a unique thought.
	Luka and Kylie got this team cooking now…. When they first got together I couldn’t see it but now they are dangerous
	Great work Kyrie
	I think they will clinch playoffs and not need to do a play in.. Luka and Kylie is an amazing pairing.
	I think kyrie has bought in to dallas and especially luka
	 i don't think so
	Kyrie is the Genius of Basket.
	I might cheer for the 3 Texas teams for their remaining games, lol!
	Best guard in the league
	Kyrieeeeclutch 🔥 14pts in the 4th Q
	Cuidado con esta dupla 🔥🔥
	Monk may be out for the season, won't make it out of the play in
	Great comeback W 🔥
	So the trade did work out!! Now it’s up too Kidd to get them to where they need to go,, I thought they needed another player down in the paint but I guess not, mavs on a good run ,, let’s go Mavs!!!
	Kyrie is the mvp in cavs team nba finals
	Kyrie the Batman!
	ramadhan kareem brother idol kyrie irving allah always guide you...watching from philippines🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🕋🕋🕋
	We’re getting hot at the right time. Watch out in the playoffs.
	BRINGIN IT HOME 
	Go Mavs 😎  
	yes sir mavs win.💪
	Mavs NBA FINALS
	Fun game to watch last night
	Luka really played well
	Dallas 💙💙
	Black is Cedis
	Great work keep it up 💕 with love and happiness enjoy
	Refs came in clutch with the 12-31 FT disparity. It’s pretty bad tbh
	 and Mavs missed over 10 of them. Don’t act like Mavs are the Lakers, they normally don’t get the star treatment, even with Luka.
	So close
	Dallas is quickly becoming the team nobody wants to face in the playoffs
	He looks better than ever!
	they are really good but is not enough for a chip
	Great
	We got a chance to win it all if THJ wakes up out of his shooting slump!
	When Luka magic lost game last time??🤔
	Couldn’t get one more assist for me
	Go to play gaza muhamad
	ok ah mav
	Great work Kyrie and Luka.
	Fasting makes him stronger, alhamdulillah ☪️🕋🤲🏾🇵🇸
	imagine if Covid popped up in 2024 🤣🤣🤣
	Kyrie Irving
	Another Great Win For The Mavericks
	 yes
	hands up! great game kyrie 💓
	good game ❤
	
	👏👏💪💪💪
	👀
	❤❤❤
	💪
	Good. The Kings have no bench and Sabonis is starting to come back down to earth since the NBA told the refs to let them play defense in the interior.
	Mavs are playing good basketball. Like, good basketball. The critics can eat a d..
	Lakers couldn't do this
	14 forth quarter points for uncle drew
	Ramadan Kyrieee 🔥🔥🔥
	Awesome ‼️
	Dallas Mavericks Vs Sacramento Kings
	Dante with the dagger!
	  Yea after missing the last 3, and a blown lay up, I was hoping he made that one
	 Exactly 🤣😅
	 I was screaming at the tv stop giving him the dang ball and give to the hot hand Irving. Then bam Dante hits it
	For football tips
	Great Win...<a class=💙💙
	Let's go Mavericks!
	Mashallah Ramadan Special right there. 👊🏽
	great game
	Dallas
	Second round exit
	Amazing!
