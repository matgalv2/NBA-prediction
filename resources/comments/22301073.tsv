TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Kyrie and Luka magic! The real deal!
	This is a different team. This kind of games are used to be out of hand when their 3s aren't going in, but now they answer with defensive stops and physicality, they just never give up. We're playoff ready man.
	Two absolutely MASSIVE wins against the Kings this week.  Tied up the season series and gave Dallas a two game cushion.  Exum missed a few down the stretch but they kept coming back to him and he finally delivered what would be the dagger 3.  I love the way this team is playing right now.  #MFFL
	Dave Myers #MFFL the trades helped our defense and rebounding. We will be a scary out!
	Dave Myers Dallas is dangerous this season
	Dallas teammates’s trust on exum in those clutch situation is better than my wife’s trust on me
	Renato Lopez HAHAHAHA
	🤣🤣
	🤣
	Jean C. Rojas Irizarry bueno Irving lo marcan y luka lo marcan la lógica dice que se la pases al otro tipo que esta solo y cobra millones de dolares
	🤣
	🤣👌
	🤣
	For football tips
	They are playing good, but I don’t see them beating teams like OKC. They would sweep them for sure!
	Mavs 10-1 in the last 11 games, only game they lost was when Luka sat. They are the scariest team in the west outside of Denver
	Edin Budic 
	Amir Wasserman total difference from last year
	Beau Dekerguelen sure
	Edin Budic idk mavs are starting to look more
	Edin Budic first round exit
	Edin Budic the team they play next is dangerous and on a 10 game winning streak. Houston Rockets
	Edin Budic As a team they're starting to show the same chemistry as the 2011 team.
	Edin Budic Denver overrated without bruce brown getting was their heart
	Edin Budic honestly
	thank you dallas, lakeshow top 6 continues 🔥
	Yeah!!! Let's get it!! Mavs on fire 🔥💯🔥🤗🤗
	Sacramento bout to join the Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Rockets in the intense battle for the 10th seed! 😤😩😭💀🤣
	Kidd was finally doing what is right , get THJ out and the other dudes if there shooting slump. Sub em with a more confident player and not a liability in defense . Good job MAVS 💙
	Jayjay Serilla Depol and calling timeouts when the game was getting a bit erratic.
	Exum missing two open 3s and a layup, then draining that dagger 3. Sheeesh #PlayoffReady
	I guess Kyrie’S found another great team and team mates
	Those defensive stops in the last few minutes of the game is like a foresight of things to come in the playoffs... Great win for the Mavs, although, I almost had a heart attack everytime the Kings score.
	Michael San Antonio Same here
	Can't believe kyrie isn't top 75 yeah he has his personal issues but he's an insane ball player.
	Tae Pak he has the fault of saying what he thinks in a world of sheeps with a unique thought.
	Luka and Kylie got this team cooking now…. When they first got together I couldn’t see it but now they are dangerous
	I think they will clinch playoffs and not need to do a play in.. Luka and Kylie is an amazing pairing.
	Great work Kyrie
	I think kyrie has bought in to dallas and especially luka
	Anthony Giovanni Brewster i don't think so
	Kyrie is the Genius of Basket.
	I might cheer for the 3 Texas teams for their remaining games, lol!
	Best guard in the league
	Kyrieeeeclutch 🔥 14pts in the 4th Q
	Monk may be out for the season, won't make it out of the play in
	Great comeback W 🔥
	Kyrie is the mvp in cavs team nba finals
	Cuidado con esta dupla 🔥🔥
	So the trade did work out!! Now it’s up too Kidd to get them to where they need to go,, I thought they needed another player down in the paint but I guess not, mavs on a good run ,, let’s go Mavs!!!
	We’re getting hot at the right time. Watch out in the playoffs.
	Kyrie the Batman!

	BRINGIN IT HOME 
	Go Mavs 😎 #WeComing #WeOnAMission
	Mavs NBA FINALS
	Misael Benitez first round exit
	yes sir mavs win.💪
	Fun game to watch last night
	Luka really played well
	Dallas 💙💙
	Black is Cedis
	Great work keep it up 💕 with love and happiness enjoy
	Refs came in clutch with the 12-31 FT disparity. It’s pretty bad tbh
	Patrick Dunn and Mavs missed over 10 of them. Don’t act like Mavs are the Lakers, they normally don’t get the star treatment, even with Luka.
	So close
	Dallas is quickly becoming the team nobody wants to face in the playoffs
	He looks better than ever!
	they are really good but is not enough for a chip
	Great
	We got a chance to win it all if THJ wakes up out of his shooting slump!
	When Luka magic lost game last time??🤔
	Couldn’t get one more assist for me
	Go to play gaza muhamad
	ok ah mav
	Great work Kyrie and Luka.
	Fasting makes him stronger, alhamdulillah ☪️🕋🤲🏾🇵🇸

	Good. The Kings have no bench and Sabonis is starting to come back down to earth since the NBA told the refs to let them play defense in the interior.
	Mavs are playing good basketball. Like, good basketball. The critics can eat a d..
	Lakers couldn't do this
	14 forth quarter points for uncle drew
	Ramadan Kyrieee 🔥🔥🔥
	Awesome ‼️
