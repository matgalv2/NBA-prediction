	The Missing Piece We Playoff Bound Baby
	Everybody need to step up.
	Good job💪🏾💯
	Healthy Divincenzo &gt; <a class=💯
	Great win , I also deleted my draft kings sports app, 
	Never  understood why Kerr let him go.
	I always say it. No more changes. The NY Knicks are coupled. If he arrives healthy in the playoffs there could be surprises. Up my NY Knicks 🏀
	Only matters if you’re an All-Star 🤣🤣
	I'm still asking myself why did the Warriors let him go.
	He’s better than curry
	Wow, impressed. <a class=
	I don't know what all the hype is about they legit were versing the pistons
	Donte playing 40 minutes. Knicks are winning.  Curry 30 minutes and warriors are losing.  Curry should be playing 36-40 minutes when game is close. Prob have more wins and not in 10 the place.
	As usual, the clueless coach played Donte and Hart another 40 minutes in a blow out..Game was well in hand early..
	Bro took all the powers of Steph after leaving the Warriors.
	 😆 Nice he learned lots from those two shooters . Thanks GSW
	Nova Knicks!!
	Good job 👏🏾
	Go Donte! Once a Wildcat always a Wildcat!
	Awesome game
	Could have been 12 ref didn’t see why take it away
	Pistons would go 12-70 this season
	He did it against the worse team In the league no props! A girls high school team could beat the pistons this year!
	ooh boy, it's 60 losses already 😅
	Villanova connection.
	The Knicks needed a Shooter like this on the team he's a great complement
	Donte 3Vincenzo= black Steph curry
	Wayv g o g o, Nova Knicks
	Miss you donte
	LeDivincenzo
	GSW poor decision to reject this guy!
	Why hart still playing 40 min.  Game was blowout entire time
	Dude is special. Respect.
	James Wiseman &amp; Divincenzo a mistake by GSW they traded.😭
	This is who the warriors gave up for 40 yr old Chris Paul 
	They played Detroit big deal.
	Sad state the league is in now
	40 points,  Donte DiVincenzo
	Stephen Curry effect
	Stay hot... You and Deuce
	yes sir 💪
	could be the new splash bro man 🔥
	Scalabrine son?
	Love Donte
	40 pieces of chicken and 5 biscuits 🍗🍗😃
	March madness vibes
	Keep him or you’ll regret it
	Detroit Pistons Vs New York Knicks
