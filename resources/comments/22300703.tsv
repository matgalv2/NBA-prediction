TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Love my Cavs! They are moving up in the East. One game below the Bucks. 🏀❤️🏀
	Cleveland Cavaliers Vs San Antonio Spurs
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling yeah check who else they beat.
	Hey NBA just want to inform you that your ADs destroys your game recap videos. its either not working, no sound, or Advertisment sounds playing while watching the videos!!! its not only on 1 video and not only today since you decided to just slap the Ad videos on the games recap!!
	I feel sorry for San Antonio Spurs 😭. 10-40 is a disaster. It is believed that the Spurs coach is the highest paid coach in the NBA, yet the team has fallen short. What a waste of money 💰.
	Lawrence Rowland maybe the team doesn't care about winning.
	Cleveland 🏀 !
	Supernova is on fire🔥💪
	Imagine LeBron back on this team
	Supernova is on fire🔥💪

	Remember before the season started when all of the media was hyping Wemby like he was gonna save the Spurs SMH LOL 🤣 OUCH.
	Michael William Cassidy he Still will.   he's like 15 years old.. relax ..be a real bball fan
	Marshall James 10 wins.. lol
	Michael William Cassidy u casual. LoL
	Marshall James nah just the facts
	Michael William Cassidy no one thought the spurs were going to be anything this season. They said long term he will turn around the franchise.
	Michael William Cassidy Nobody said that he would save the Spurs in 50 games.
	Shan Johnson They labeled him “the next Lebron James” which was completely ridiculous.
	Michael William Cassidy Who is ‘they’? I’ve seen articles that labeled him the biggest prospect since LeBron, but no one actually called him the next LeBron James.
	Shan Johnson They overhyped the kid before the season started,and now the Spurs have “10” wins lol priceless.
	Michael William Cassidy Lebron had the same hype too before his first season and he finished with 36 wins, but no one wrote him off like you’re trying to write off Wendy. 
	Shan Johnson Not writing him off,just saying they should’ve slowed down with the hype,the kid is not a savior. The Spurs are a long way away from being anything even remotely close to being a good team. 10 wins is brutal.
	Michael William Cassidy Nobody called him a savior, not sure where you got that from.  All I saw was him being called the biggest prospect since LeBron James. And that was 100% true. It just seems like you’re adding stuff into it that was never said. I never read or heard anyone call him a savior. I never read or heard anyone call him the next Lebron James.
	Shan Johnson They overhyped him before the season started now they look dumb cause the Spurs have 10 wins,if you notice they’re not talking about him or the Spurs as much on espn anymore.
	Michael William Cassidy Who is ‘they’??
	Shan Johnson All media outlets
	Michael William Cassidy Can you find one source that called him a Savior? Or one that called him the next LeBron James? Because I sure can’t.
	Shan Johnson Lebron won Rookie of the Year easily,Wemby might not even win ROY,Chet has a great chance to win it. They overhyped Wemby and the Spurs are just as terrible as they were last season. Gotta slow down with the hype train sometimes,they did the same thing with Zion and he’s been injured more than he’s been healthy.
	Michael William Cassidy That’s not what I asked you. I asked you if you could find one source that called Wemby a savior before he was drafted. How about a source that literally called him the next LeBron James?
	Shan Johnson I don’t remember who exactly it was but that’s what was said. They overhyped him to the max before the season started and the Spurs are actually worse than they were last season,gotta slow down that hype train. Even ESPN knows that’s why they stopped talking so much about him and the Spurs. 10 wins is awful.
	Michael William Cassidy No one said anything of that. No one.
	Shan Johnson believe whatever you want. Bottom line is they overhyped the guy to the max and they’re a worse team with him than they were last season that’s a fact.
	Michael William Cassidy Because there was no reason to think that anyone 7’5” with an 8’ wing span, who can palm a basketball with just 2 fingers would be a difference maker. The hype was justified, but no one called him the next LeBron James, or said that he was a savior.
	Shan Johnson Well the hype has died for good reason,10 wins is horrible. Spurs have a ton of work to do,gonna take 7 years at least to rebuild that team.
	Michael William Cassidy How long do you think that Hype is supposed to last? The word itself means ‘intensive publicity or promotion’. Who still promotes an event 50 games after it starts? The hype isn’t supposed to last for 50 games.
	Shan Johnson Ok if you say so.
	Michael William Cassidy what Wemby needs is some veterans to show him some guidance .
	Donovan Mitchell
	Admin! Just Wemby? You are lazy, you are fired!
	Cavs big men  Allen and Mobley had one hell of a game too! They were ballin! They were awesome! Go Cavs! 🏀🏀🏀
