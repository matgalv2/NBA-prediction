	Avdija 2nd Career 30+ point game.
	Congratulations Raptors 🏆🏀
	You're too fast boss quickly
	Immanuel Quickley too quick
	The Quicksilver
	❤️❤️❤️
	💙
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	IQ come back to the Knicks in the offseason we miss you
	Gabe Bottazzi can’t afford him. He’s trying to get starting pg money. We got Brunson and Deuce now. Let IQ go. I miss him too. But he’s running his own team now.
	Gabe Bottazzi we’re not letting him go
	Deuce is a fraction of the cost and actually plays defense. Having Deuce sign that extension was first by Rose.
	Michael Meduridon’t disrespect Quick like he didn’t play defense. He doesn’t play on a Thibbs team if he doesn’t play defense.
	Steven Lee Delgadoyeah I’m not hating on Quick he was a likable Knick and def played solid defense per the metrics, he just going require the bag and Deuce hasn’t let us down, he’s playing extremely well and is getting paid like minimum. Rose really got some dawgs on cheap contracts, Deuce, Brunson, Stein, Donte all make a fraction of what they would as free agents this year.
	Knicks should have never made this happen let IQ go to another team mistake big time.
	Un físico maldito tiene ese mago para jugar
	Immanuel Quickley
	Knicks didn’t want this guy anymore um ok
	Is the girl from South Carolina related to him?
	Livewire Flames who's the girl?
	Linda Isabella she’s a basketball player on the South Carolina University team
	Livewire Flames oh thanks for letting me know
	Livewire Flames OMG! I asked the same question. No shade, but when she was at the foul line, I  saw a close resemblance.
