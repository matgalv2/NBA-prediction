	Thank you Boston for beating the Kings and giving the Lakers a chance to eventually overtake them! Let’s go Lakers! 😅👏🫶🤞👌✌️🙌
	 feels disgusting cheering on the Celtics for us to scrape into the 8th seed but needs must
	I don't remember the last time the Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings without money or gambling involved
	I wasn't aware Duren and Kispert played for the Kings now.
	Lakers fans don't even have a game today but they're celebrating on every Celtics post 🤣😁
	 fanboys
	
	 sure am
	 Lakers fans are!! 😆 🤣
	 celtics cant even beat Lakers bench 🤣
	 You casually left the fact that Boston beat their entire roster in LA on christmas day. Try again lol
	 🤡🤡🤡 just be happy that the Celtics helped out the desperate Lakers.
	 austin reave itself can destroy celtics healthy team….🤣🤣🤣
	 Let me fix it for you bud. 
	 still austin reave can destroy   Overrated celtics team…for sure will bye bye for 1st round🤣
	 and the Celtics destroy a fully healthy lakers squad. Stick to the pba
	As a Lakers fan never thought I would root so much for Boston Lol
	Boston best record 61 win 16loss
	Celtics, Spurs, Mavs, and Wolves! We love you all!
	thank you boston, lakeshow moving to 8th seed🤭
	 still a first round exit, don’t get too excited🥱
	 Kings beat the Lakers before and they're the same with 43-33 win-loss record😂
	X-Man was the real hero...
	"He spaces the floor realy well, allows the wing players room to operate 1 on 1 and can shoot the 3. Does anyone remember the nickname ""Unicorn"" ?"
	Good job team and great game .. congrats for celtics winner in the game .. i hope all team celtics always success career in the NBA, always happy and enjoy your day ..
	As a Laker fan thank you Boston🤢🤮🤣
	Boston was trying to give that game to Kings to prevent Lakers move to 8th seed😁
	 I mean they rested their starters most of the 4th. While the celtics bench was playing against the kings starters.
	Thank you Boston from Lakers fans 🤗
	A game against the Pistons and Wizards, at the same time?🤣
	The man with the coolest name
	" can you remember them calling him 'Unicorn"""
	Hahaha huwag kayong mag thank you Lakers fans dahil parang galit ang kanilang management nung naipasok ni Tillman ang bola dahil sya lang ang natutuwa pero parang galit yong mga teammates nya.cguro hindi sya nasabihan ng plano ng taga Boston dahil <a tabindex=😂😂✌🏀
	A wins a win.  TINGIS PINGIS BABY!!!!!
	Celtics have to get a chip
	As a Lakers fan we always want to see the Celtics lose.  However, they are helping our standings in the West.
	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪
	Boston Celtics vs Washington Pistons
	Yea the Knicks were down 21 and won by 15
	Celtics vs Detroit Wizards
	1 point win, this was a tough game
	Great game tonight  Celtics win 🥇
	Thank you boston - lebron fan here
	One of the best season in celtics history 💪
	Our beloved Rival team Celtics thank you so much for your service Lakers fans so happy moving to 8th seed.
	Love this guy dives me kevin love vibes
	nice now lakers can pass kings  ez
	🔥
	Jalen Duren?
	They almost blew it.
	"That's why they brought him there. Brown and Tatum are who they are, but the head coach is wise to change over to real basketball when the situation calls for it. With Porzingis, there is no need to just be a ""chuck 'em up and hope they go in"" team down the stretch"
	If Porter from Toronto is under investigation for posible Bettings, Why Mazula from Boston Celtics is not?It looks like he want to lose the game. He played last quarter with players from the end of the bench⁉️🤔
	, hold your God awful officials accountable. Celtics lost, Kings won, Officials blew another one. What is this, the 100th game this year that the last two minutes and final score have been decided by these incompetent fools. What’s the point of replay or F2M if you won’t use it to correct the incorrect.
	Nice to know but who is Duren and Kispert??
	THANK YOU 🤩 CELTICS, SPURS and MAVS from LAKERS FANS 💜💛 WE LOVE YOU ALL 😅😂🤣
	Coach celtics want to lose his team.haha amazing coaching.
	Ese juego está reñido pa mi el Juego más reñido que jugao Boston Celtics en su cancha está temporada y  cuidao con de Aaron fox en ese momento quedando :27.0 encestó ese cansataso de tres por el lado derecho de la cancha pa poner arriba a los sacramento kings 100-99 Fox fallo un jumper pa empatar el juego quedando poco :05.4 pero con eso encestó 40 Fox Celtics consigue su Víctora número 61 eta temporada crédito a Payton Pritchard que fue el último máximo anotador del partido tirando de 5/10 50% algo raro sacramento supero en triple a Boston eh este juego no sorprende tanto por este equipo de los kings colectivo en total tiene 1,100 triples hechos convertidos eta temporada número 5 en esta temporada Boston el líder con 1,272 triples hechos y un porcentaje entre la nubes de 38.8 altísimo líder en porcentaje tambíen
	a crazy match

	"Imma do this once sending 5 grand to the first 6 people to hmu with ""GOD IS GOOD"" cus i feel some people going through difficulties, Y'all stay Blessed"
	 Amen
	Wow, that was a close game.
	 last 9 min of the quarter the coach put the bench against the starters of the kings because they were up by 20

	"The world is rotten and people don't mind, we aren´t here to enjoy or have fun, this life is a proof. It´s incredible, no matter how difficult the situation gets, almost no one wants to obey GOD - JESUS CHRIST and TRULY do his will (far away from religious denominations, are all false, without exceptions), as John 14:21 says --&gt; ""He who has my commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my FATHER; and I will love him and manifest myself to him"". And it is true that it is hard to follow HIM, but I also tell you that it is more rewarding than anything in the world ""for what benefit will a man gain if he gains the whole world but loses his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"" Matthew 16:26"
	...AND IS AT THE GATES, THE DOOR OF SALVATION HAS ALMOST BEEN CLOSED.
	"""And I heard another voice from heaven, which said: Come out of her, my people, so that you do not participate in her sins, nor receive part of her plagues; for her sins have reached heaven, and GOD has remembered her wickedness. ."""
	Well, I repeat again. Who does not depart from ALL the system of the world (which is ruled by evil), and leave religious denominations, whose doctrines are wrong, nothing from working in the system of the beast, or going to hospitals, or taking children to school, or going to restaurants... Take the leap of FAITH and let GOD sustain you.
	"""Adulteresses! (refers to souls) Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity toward GOD? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is made an enemy of GOD."""
	"""The LORD JESUS CHRIST does not delay the promise, as some consider it delay, but is patient toward you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."""
	"""He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; he who loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it; and he who loseth his life for my sake shall find it."""
	🔥🔥 Glory and fear of GOD and our LORD JESUS CHRIST that are ONE (John 10:30) 🔥🔥
