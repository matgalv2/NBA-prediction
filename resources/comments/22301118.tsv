	They almost blew it.
	"That's why they brought him there. Brown and Tatum are who they are, but the head coach is wise to change over to real basketball when the situation calls for it. With Porzingis, there is no need to just be a ""chuck 'em up and hope they go in"" team down the stretch"
	If Porter from Toronto is under investigation for posible Bettings, Why Mazula from Boston Celtics is not?It looks like he want to lose the game. He played last quarter with players from the end of the bench⁉️🤔
