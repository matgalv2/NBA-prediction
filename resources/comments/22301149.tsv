TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Def best knick of my all time since Ive been alive in my book.
	S Paul Driguez randle will be missed in playoff
	Adib Ahmed Khan randle? ..whos randle?.....
	Adib Ahmed Khan question should actually be are we missing RJ barrett
	Lowkey People’s MVP
	Caruso should’ve held him all game
	Dexter Lockhart-Turner Lmaoo he did
	Dexter Lockhart-Turner tough assignment for him
	Congratulations Knicks team on the victory
	Brunson should be recognized as an MVP candidate. He deserves so much respect for how impactful he is as a player and a leader! 💙🧡
	Idk how this man is not getting at least some MVP consideration. He remind me of Derrick rose only in terms of usage. Tom is gonna exhaust him before the playoffs. I pray the basketball gods keep him relatively healthy his whole career.
	To my surprise he has carried this team. Respect
	"He showed out against my Heat in the playoffs last year. Spo was like ""how is that guy not an All-star?"" That said, the Heat are coming. Herro with 33pts. Butler 25/8/9. Jovic 23/8 rebs. 😂 all you want. They are playoff built."
	Eric Henry amazing how you managed to turn this post into a plug for the Heat
	Liam Robinson I am amazing. That's for sure!
	Great player a leader and makes everyone play on the team good for him let’s go Knicks
	This is what happens when the NBA insists upon ZERO defense.
	Mavs slept on him. Knicks picked him up and he just been killing it .. 🫡
	next contract should be maxi
	Mvp candidate 🤔🤔🤔
	"Jalen "" Charles "" Brunson"
	He been going crazy 🔥💯
	Just imagine if he stayed in Dallas they’ll be much better than with ky
	Marcel G Briggs he was better without luka
	We need move from Robertson in this playoffs run or trade him this off season
	MVP!!!
	MVP runner up
	MVP! 🫶🏽💙🧡
	Jalen Brunson

	2023-2024 NBA world champion The golden states Warriors FMVP King Jonathan kuminga Mark my word!!
