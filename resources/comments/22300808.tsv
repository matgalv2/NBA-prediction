TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	It wasn’t Giannis or Dame. It was all Doc who won that game. Greatest coach ever.
	James Armstrong Samley greatest chokerist of all time
	He missed less free throws today glad to see him improving that side of the game shot the three with confidence today.
	Dame hit all the threes at the ASG &amp; wanna go 2-8 from downtown lmao what
	Dre Thomas yes, he definitely wants to go 2-8 you nailed it
	Dre Thomas he's been shooting horrible all season....except for All Star weekend 😒
	every time the haters cry, some great athlete laughs... 🤫
	This was a nice win  let's see if the bucks can' keep it going 👍
	Giannis 21 FTs
	Connor LeClair points are points! But good game man!
	Connor LeClair and the ones Giannis were getting were puff cake fouls.
	Connor LeClair Same 💩 as embiid yet everyone praises Giannis
	Connor LeClair hard for wolves bigs to get calls when they don't attack the rim. 3 point specialist KAT isn't gonna draw any calls jacking up all those 3s
	Connor LeClair try attacking the paint and not avoiding contact then? Ant was literally the only Wolves player doing that all game. Meanwhile Giannis does that all game every game
	Connor LeClair Yeah he got fouled hard at the rim every time
	Connor LeClair giannis gets hit the most out of every big guy cuz he takes it to the hoop 95% of the time. He should get 40 fts a game if they actually called fouls!
	Connor LeClair yeah man for real
	Connor LeClair well thats what happens when a team mostly shoots jumpers and Giannis play on the paint.
	25-13 free throw comparisons is crazy, Portes basically tackled Gobert and they turn around and call the foul on Gobert sad to watch Refs dictate games for a certain reason
	Shawn C. Goodman I mean I think it was McDaniels who basically punched Beasley and it didn't get called but ok lol
	Shawn C. Goodman keep crying 😢
	Shawn C. Goodman what game were you watching? 🤦‍♀️
	Great game. Little sloppy at times, but a week off will do that. I got alittle sloppy myself watching the game.  😆
	Fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 Gianis ❤️❤️❤️❤️

	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
	It was all the refs giving it to the bucks so dumb they can’t just call it down the middle
	Just watched the highlights…9 minutes of Giannis shooting free throws.🤣🤣🤣
	Best team i love you ❤️
	Just a word to other teams, if you look at Giannis wrong, they will call a foul on you. Holy hell.
	🚨 casual alert 🚨
	Dan Torres naaa stop cappin
	Shanty Caceres
	Dan Torres thats why we own ya ☘️☘️🤝
	Shanty Caceres how many chips Jfrauds got again?
	Ted Nichols are you choosing to forget when Giannis was called for a foul... for looking at someone???
	Alex Kutz well if it happened once, that was a fraction of how many times it happened to the Wolves.
	The referees &amp; Adam Silver is making Giannis “LeBron 2.0”… Adam silver must go.. we have enough for these in past ten years of “lebron era’s “
	CHAMPION!
	That’s wild, 33 points but 21 ft’s. Lol
	Yes about time
