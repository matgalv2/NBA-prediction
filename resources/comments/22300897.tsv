LAC	Kawhi Leonard
LAC	People who's saying wemby is the rookie of the year, or Luka should be top 5 in MVP because of his stats is like saying Sengun is better than kawhi. Look at the stat difference
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Houston Rockets
LAC	Yes 👍
HOU	Just like I said in the beginning of the season that time will show the Rockets won’t make the playoff.
LAC	The claw has lost his urgency on defense tho seen him miss a layup and then jist casually jog back in last nights game maybe he needs more load management
LAC	Comeback Clips strike agakn!!
