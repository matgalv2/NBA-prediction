	Yeheee! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 #ClipperNation job well done😎👍🙂🙏
	Kawhi Leonard
	People who's saying wemby is the rookie of the year, or Luka should be top 5 in MVP because of his stats is like saying Sengun is better than kawhi. Look at the stat difference
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Houston Rockets
	Yes 👍
	Just like I said in the beginning of the season that time will show the Rockets won’t make the playoff.
	The claw has lost his urgency on defense tho seen him miss a layup and then jist casually jog back in last nights game maybe he needs more load management
	Comeback Clips strike agakn!!
	💪💪💪
	Clippers…..Babee‼️❤️👊🏾🏀
	Sengun is ready for the MIP
	Kitz Madredijo Tyrese Maxey wants to have a word
	Earl Marius Posadas he an all star already
