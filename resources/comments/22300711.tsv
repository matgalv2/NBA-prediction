TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
UTA	the #jazz put out a total team effort in the 4th to outscore the #bucks!!! what a game by them!!! congrats for the win 🙂
MIL	Doc Rivers choking masterclass already on full effect.
	Dan Canong all star coach 🤣
MIL	Doc said play like it’s game 7 🤣😂
	Marco Bape lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
UTA	What a 4th quarter for the Jazz. TAKE NOTE!
UTA	As a jazz fan ,Thank you for letting Doc take the reigns and continue his folded arms tour
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Utah Jazz
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
MIL	The bucks look clueless on defense. They won't make it far in the playoffs.
	Lebogang Letsoalo jrue holiday ang sinayang nila may opensa at depensa
	Patrick Beverley a better coach than Doc Rivers 😩😭☠️🤣
MIL	Doc will be fired after 5 games 🤣🤣🤣🤣
MIL	No offense… but the Bucks gave up one of the best defenders in the league. Consequences.
MIL	they'll bounce back but wait till a game 7 lol jks
MIL	Bucks 1-3 under Doc Rivers.
MIL	So glad Doc came back in time for the Jazz game I'm not going to lie they had us in the 1st half
MIL	The bucks have no sack lol 😂
	Now that’s an All-Star coaching effort!
UTA	Sexton didn’t play the whole 4 quarter
	😂 Sixers beat the Jazz without 3 starters
	How do you come back and win by 15 ? 😂
MIL	The Doc Rivers effect. Can’t wait to see that 3-1 blown playoff series this May!
MIL	The bucks are a first round exit come playoff time
MIL	Awesome start from Doc 😆
UTA	Congrats key and team utah ..get winner in the game
	Player of the game for Utah: Refs.
	1 - 4 record = all stars coach
	hahaha nice again nba 😆
UTA	Champion ulit jazz
MIL	An y’all thought Doc was the answer plz gth
UTA	coach griffin approves
	Just look at...
	This season:
	I think you messed this post up NBA. The Referees gave the Utah Jazz this win over the Bucks.
	Laura Schumann bucks kept chucking up threes…
	Zach Warnick true. Because that’s their default. The Bucks aren’t completely not at fault here. But the officiating is what gave the Jazz this win. Saxton should have been tossed from this game.
	Zach Warnick That’s what the Jazz did for three quarters… Once Clarkson got in they started cutting and going for drives. That’s a big reason why the were so good in the 4th, they weren’t just “chucking” threes
	Laura Schumann first of all it’s Sexton. Second of all the Bucks had 25 free throws and the Jazz had 24. What were you saying again about the refs handing the Jazz the win?
	Laura Schumann ya and biden Is a stand up president 🙄
	Kurtis Hancock I feel bad for you if you think the officiating in this game was fair. Maybe you should be a ref too
	Laura Schumann it was quit crying like Joe biden
	Kurtis Hancock why are you bringing Biden into a sports conversation?
	Laura Schumann why are you crying about the refs???????????????
MIL	I can’t believe the Bucks chose Doc over all of you couch coaches!!  What in the world were they thinking???!!! 🤔 you all deserve millions for your brilliance 🙄
	Elsa Dell you tell them Elsa...
MIL	Why are the bucks losing games they should win?? They have 2 players in the All stars. Lillard sucks in my opinion but you know what I mean
MIL	And Doc RIvers make 40 millions
MIL	Hard to win when your 2nd best player goes 5-18 and 1/8 from 3.
	Michael Anthony coach fault
	Michael Anthony Because all of thier losses dame average 15 points below. but they can win if dame.score 20 plus or 30. His problem is He is a scorer only. has no deffense..he is useless if he has ofdnigjt because he cant help the team in deffense.
MIL	Ouch. Bad loss by the Bucks.
MIL	Free Giannis please what is his teammate doing 😡😡😤
MIL	I hope the bucks will meltdown lol. Blaming the coach Adrien Griffin was a bad move.karma is real
	Nivla Zuproc Omotsosirc The coach is not a problem. Dame is a problem. Because all of the bucks loses dame scores 15 points below.. He is a scorer. If he has ofnight. He cant help in team deffense. And facilitate the ball like true point gaurd. He has … Wyświetl więcej
	Sandee Jay Sanchez that's why they bring  a new coach to integrate a system with players. That's my point the first place. Why fire Griffin...
	Nivla Zuproc Omotsosirc Because Thats the problem also in griffins coaching,  Always they loss if lillard scores less and no defense. why trade jrue holiday in first place. Holiday can facilitate a play and a strong in D,  that can defend the wings.  t… Wyświetl więcej
	Sandee Jay Sanchez then it's the bucks as an organization.  Bidenholzer was great until they think he's not.  They hired griffin and they panicked and fired him midseason. Now they bring in rivers and they're just as bad. Lillard is an overrated scorer… Wyświetl więcej
	Nivla Zuproc Omotsosirc yess, and you think gannis can sustain his kind of play style right now after 4 to 5 years? when his athletism Start to decline? . Pure athLetiscm. having no jumpshot and 3 points. and no consistent free throW. He is not effecti… Wyświetl więcej
MIL	Karma is now showing
	Wow this is phenomenal! Pls keep clarkson on your roster thanks!
	Serve them right
UTA	Good job Jazz. Another pathetic performance by the Bucks.🤦
MIL	Doc Rivers effect 😅
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović Jazz ipak ne pada već konstantno igra toplo hladno, mogu od svakog izgubit ali i dobit top ekipe kao Buckse..
	Ante Boban Jazz je bio pao, vezali su 3 poraza, pa dobila ih preksinoć Phila bez Embiida, Batuma, Morrisa, Covingtona itd. Ovo je Riversov poraz više nego pobjeda Jazza. Otkad je on sjeo na klupu Bucksi su izgubili #2 a dobiju li Knicksi Grizzliese - odoše Bucksi na #4.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović nije Rivers zabijao za Jazzere..Jazzeri stalno ovako igraju, stalno su na nekih 50%, pobjeda gore, pobjeda dolje..
	Ante Boban nije Rivers zabijao za Jazzere ali otkad je on na klupi izgubili su čak i od Blazersa. Blazersa koji nisu imali ni klupu uslijed povreda. Nego do koga je ako nije do Riversa? A tim mu je kompletan. I sinoć je imao utakmicu u svojim rukama i … Wyświetl więcej
	I think the lakers need to hire the former bucks head coach
	Ayaw talaga paiwan Jazz sa Lakers
	Dan Mante e charlotte kalaban ng lakers bukas medyo madali talunin
	JP C. Cate mismo lalayo ule haha
	Dan Mante injured pa ang halos lahat ng starters ng charlotte at wala narin si rosier at uhaw ang lakers ng winning streak at nakapahinga na si AD at LBJ kaya at seseryosohin nila ang larong ito kasi 3 days na naman pahinga nila ulit bago ang denver sa friday
	JP C. Cate San kaya pwede makipagpustahan online?
	Matik yan
MIL	you're giving this win to climb a bit for the lakers standing smh.
MIL	The sugarcoating effect of Giannis Emmanuel C. Genterone 🙈
	Namafia na naman Parley ko inang bucks to lamang hangang 4th tapos nag choke
UTA	Getting hoed by Colin sexton were doomed
MIL	Bucks gave up 40 points in the 4th quarter utterly ridiculous
	Anthony Coriiano Celtics gave 41 pts in the 1st quarter last time they played Bucks lol
	Anthony Coriiano youre celtics got beaten by the lakers without AD and LBJ wire to wire with role players playing only at your own homecourt 🤭
MIL	Bucks are weak sauce
MIL	Choc Rivers and the Milwaukee Chucks . Yeaaahh!
	Fanasina Rasolomampionona 🤭
