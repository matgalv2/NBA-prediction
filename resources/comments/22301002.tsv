	GA Cookin again 👏👏
	Yes!

	That man went from being labeled one of the dirtiest player in the league to one of the best shooters in the league 😮‍💨 that’s tough
	Trè Holley he was always a good shooter tho lol. He was actually always a solid player on both ends.
	Exactly Booker and KD need to quit trying to be a star every damn game and let Allen help them out. Play as a team get more wins
	Anthony Baldenegro you’re right. Good win given a combined big 3 total under 45 points
	Good job Ted Cruz! Pride of the GOP! ❤️❤️
	3 superstars and Alan have to bail them out 😂😂😂
	🤔
	😂😂😂😂
	Well is the draymond green highlight being a dirty player knocking over a coach and no real penalty. How many times long does he have to be a dirty player for a real penalty to happen
	Mark Daigle u look as dirty as him
	He can dunk too that what's crazy
	Phoenix vs bucks in the Finals, Rematch
	Better than Beal
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Phoenix Suns
	This team Without Embid🤣
	Ñbä Mëd that's why he's the MVP
	Ñbä Mëd same thing the last time when suns was short handed.lol
	Ñbä Mëd embid not guarding Allen. Just ssying
	Ñbä Mëd 
	Ñbä Mëd superstar Maxey played well though.
