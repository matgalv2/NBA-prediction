PHX	That man went from being labeled one of the dirtiest player in the league to one of the best shooters in the league 😮‍💨 that’s tough
PHX	Trè Holley he was always a good shooter tho lol. He was actually always a solid player on both ends.
PHX	Exactly Booker and KD need to quit trying to be a star every damn game and let Allen help them out. Play as a team get more wins
	Anthony Baldenegro you’re right. Good win given a combined big 3 total under 45 points
	Good job Ted Cruz! Pride of the GOP! ❤️❤️
PHX	3 superstars and Alan have to bail them out 😂😂😂
