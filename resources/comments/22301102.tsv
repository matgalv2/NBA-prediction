TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	We went back in the early 2000s with that score.
	Frank Embuscado
	Frank Embuscado not even that long. More like early to mid 2010s
	Give Scoot a couple of years I swear he will be a menace.
	Nice, when does the fourth quarter start?
	Phil Saltee that's pretty funny
	😎👉👉
	I guess someone had to lose that game better than the other.
	🫶am currently on a project and you will be paid and credited for it?
	Congratulations Blazers 🏀🏆
	Two teams Noone cares about ❤️
	Thought I was looking at Greg Oden for a second.
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Charlotte Hornets
	Henderson may have a bright career ahead, but man Portland has a lot of building to do
	For a sec I thought Greg Oden was playing again.
	Here come them old heads about the defense 😭
	"Deandre ""air mattress"" ayton"
	Good old fashioned way of game🫣
	Loved the win! I dont care what anyone says!
	Ayton might wanna come back to the suns 😂😂
	Nice work, trail blazers
	Kinda games I like to see from scoot 👍
	Only 114 losses for the two teams, they would probably be on the top of Afghanistan league with some more effort
	Nobody wants to win this game💀
	Thought that was Greg Oden
	The one game we need to lose and we win, we can't even tank properly.
	When worst meet 😅
	Ayton led them to the exits…actually…
	Bro how long has he been in Portland ?
	Seen him on Air Mattress commercials earlier……
	Play-in bound!
	That's nambawan pick there
	Jezzzus no wonder why their records like that. They can't score ish
	And that is after spending the night sleeping on a leaky 6 month old Coleman blow up mattress set up in his buddies laundry room. This man is in pain, and still working!
	D-Ton💪
	Imagine Phoenix Suns could’ve had Luca or Trae Young, but they decided to pick this guy  BUST!!￼
	One of the most embarrassing drafts I can remember. Ayton and Bagley JR went before Luka, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Tre Young. 
	I thought this was Greg oden 💀
	This that 90s ball
	i thought it was Greg Oden at first glance..
	I see you air mattress
	Lord have mercy if think I’d rather watch pint dry
	Just needed the refs not to call the two fouls he had on miller to seal the deal lol  nba officiating is a joke
	Not bad for a 38 yo veteran
	hey is this a younger greg oden?
	Ayton Needs Legitimate Point Guard like Cp3 if Ayton Sign The Golden State Warriors is Complete Line Up
	89-86? Is this the early 2000s?
	De'Andre Ayton with double-double
	Portland vs The Hornets
	Ils n'ont joué qu'une mi-temps ??
	Lowest scoring game of season
	PINALIT mo ay BUNKS yan bugok Ng sun eh hahaha
	Look at the Win v Loss records and your surprised ?
	Blazers “lose”
	The blazers trolls are a sad group of people
	Your team lost buddy Troy Joseph
	Thought it was TBT, thought that was Oden
	Yannick Pasnin en force
	he's dominayton
	Chump
	Is 24 his career high? Dude is a bum stop hyping
	Nice, labanan ng mga LAGLAG
	HE DID SOMETHING!!!
	Greg Oden comeback????
	I thought it was Greg Oden at first glance! 😆🤭
	What in the high school girls basketball kind of score is that?
	Play-in bound!
	Good job DA
	Lazy Ayton
	dominAYTON again
	Oden with hair
	Dominayton
	Deandre Ayton
	Dominayton!
	That Greg???
	I guess
	Oops!
	Wizards &gt; Pistons &gt; no team at all &gt; Hornets
	Two minnows met, and they managed to score 175 points combined. Tragedy! Poor Hornets! Poor Trailblazers. Both teams have 38 wins combined whereas the Boston Celtics have 60 wins. How do you explain that??
	I was thinking portland resigned greg oden.
	Lazy bum DA
	DOMINANCE
	DA!
	Dominayton
	Blazers can’t even tank correctly
	Oden Redemption!
	Big woop
	Brian Kam Dominayton
