TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	We went back in the early 2000s with that score.
	Frank Embuscado
	Frank Embuscado not even that long. More like early to mid 2010s
POR	Give Scoot a couple of years I swear he will be a menace.
	Nice, when does the fourth quarter start?
POR	Phil Saltee that's pretty funny
POR	😎👉👉
CHA	I guess someone had to lose that game better than the other.
	🫶am currently on a project and you will be paid and credited for it?
POR	Congratulations Blazers 🏀🏆
POR	Two teams Noone cares about ❤️
POR	Thought I was looking at Greg Oden for a second.
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Charlotte Hornets
POR	Henderson may have a bright career ahead, but man Portland has a lot of building to do
POR	For a sec I thought Greg Oden was playing again.
POR	Here come them old heads about the defense 😭
	"Deandre ""air mattress"" ayton"
POR	Good old fashioned way of game🫣
POR	Loved the win! I dont care what anyone says!
POR	Ayton might wanna come back to the suns 😂😂
POR	Nice work, trail blazers
	Kinda games I like to see from scoot 👍
POR	Only 114 losses for the two teams, they would probably be on the top of Afghanistan league with some more effort
	Nobody wants to win this game💀
POR	Thought that was Greg Oden
POR	The one game we need to lose and we win, we can't even tank properly.
CHA	When worst meet 😅
POR	Ayton led them to the exits…actually…
POR	Bro how long has he been in Portland ?
	Seen him on Air Mattress commercials earlier……
	Play-in bound!
	That's nambawan pick there
	Jezzzus no wonder why their records like that. They can't score ish
	And that is after spending the night sleeping on a leaky 6 month old Coleman blow up mattress set up in his buddies laundry room. This man is in pain, and still working!
POR	D-Ton💪
POR	Imagine Phoenix Suns could’ve had Luca or Trae Young, but they decided to pick this guy  BUST!!￼
POR	One of the most embarrassing drafts I can remember. Ayton and Bagley JR went before Luka, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Tre Young.
	I thought this was Greg oden 💀
	This that 90s ball
	i thought it was Greg Oden at first glance..
	I see you air mattress
	Lord have mercy if think I’d rather watch pint dry
	Just needed the refs not to call the two fouls he had on miller to seal the deal lol  nba officiating is a joke
POR	Not bad for a 38 yo veteran
POR	hey is this a younger greg oden?
POR	Ayton Needs Legitimate Point Guard like Cp3 if Ayton Sign The Golden State Warriors is Complete Line Up
	89-86? Is this the early 2000s?
POR	De'Andre Ayton with double-double
	Portland vs The Hornets
	Ils n'ont joué qu'une mi-temps ??
POR	Lowest scoring game of season
