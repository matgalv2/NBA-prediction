	We went back in the early 2000s with that score.
	
	 not even that long. More like early to mid 2010s
	Give Scoot a couple of years I swear he will be a menace.
	Nice, when does the fourth quarter start?
	 that's pretty funny
	 I’m here all season 😎👉👉
	I guess someone had to lose that game better than the other.
	 can I use one of your pictures as mural art,🫶am currently on a project and you will be paid and credited for it?
	Congratulations Blazers 🏀🏆
	Thought I was looking at Greg Oden for a second.
	 ong🤣
	 same 😆
	 I came here to say the same thing 😂
	Two teams Noone cares about ❤️
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Charlotte Hornets
	For a sec I thought Greg Oden was playing again.
	Here come them old heads about the defense 😭
	 npc
	 hell yeah!!!
	Henderson may have a bright career ahead, but man Portland has a lot of building to do
	"Deandre ""air mattress"" ayton"
	Good old fashioned way of game🫣
	 you mean brick shooting at its best? 🤣
	 they were just bad
	Loved the win! I dont care what anyone says!
	 shutupstupid
	Ayton might wanna come back to the suns 😂😂
	Nice work, trail blazers
	Thought that was Greg Oden
	Kinda games I like to see from scoot 👍
	 yes they're refreshing
	When worst meet 😅
	Only 114 losses for the two teams, they would probably be on the top of Afghanistan league with some more effort
	 😂😁🤣😭🤣😂😅🙊😥😢🤧😪
	Nobody wants to win this game💀
	Bro how long has he been in Portland ?
	The one game we need to lose and we win, we can't even tank properly.
	Ayton led them to the exits…actually…
	Seen him on Air Mattress commercials earlier……
	Play-in bound!
	That's nambawan pick there
	Jezzzus no wonder why their records like that. They can't score ish
	And that is after spending the night sleeping on a leaky 6 month old Coleman blow up mattress set up in his buddies laundry room. This man is in pain, and still working!
	D-Ton💪
	Imagine Phoenix Suns could’ve had Luca or Trae Young, but they decided to pick this guy  BUST!!￼
	 Hey,𝘾𝙇𝙄𝘾𝙆 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙇𝙄𝙉𝙆 𝘼𝙉𝘿 𝘾𝙇𝘼𝙄𝙈 𝙉𝙊𝙒 𝙄𝙈𝙈𝙀𝘿𝙄𝘼𝙏𝙀𝙇𝙔 𝙏𝙊 𝙂𝙀𝙏 𝙋𝘼𝙄𝘿👇𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝐶𝑎𝑛 𝐺𝑒𝑡 𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛  20 second  ... 𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑖𝑚 𝑁𝑜𝑤.. ⬇️⬇️
	One of the most embarrassing drafts I can remember. Ayton and Bagley JR went before Luka, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Tre Young. 
	I thought this was Greg oden 💀
	 same bro 😂
	 right!!?
	 bout as useful as Oden
	 same 😳
	This that 90s ball
	I see you air mattress
	i thought it was Greg Oden at first glance..
	Just needed the refs not to call the two fouls he had on miller to seal the deal lol  nba officiating is a joke
	Lord have mercy if think I’d rather watch pint dry
	hey is this a younger greg oden?
	Not bad for a 38 yo veteran
	89-86? Is this the early 2000s?
	Ayton Needs Legitimate Point Guard like Cp3 if Ayton Sign The Golden State Warriors is Complete Line Up
	De'Andre Ayton with double-double
	Portland vs The Hornets
	Ils n'ont joué qu'une mi-temps ??
	Lowest scoring game of season
	PINALIT mo ay BUNKS yan bugok Ng sun eh hahaha
	Look at the Win v Loss records and your surprised ?
	Blazers “lose”
	The blazers trolls are a sad group of people
	Your team lost buddy 
	Thought it was TBT, thought that was Oden
	 en force
	he's dominayton
	Chump
	Is 24 his career high? Dude is a bum stop hyping
	Nice, labanan ng mga LAGLAG
	HE DID SOMETHING!!!
	Greg Oden comeback????
	I thought it was Greg Oden at first glance! 😆🤭
	What in the high school girls basketball kind of score is that?
	Play-in bound!
	Good job DA
	Lazy Ayton
	dominAYTON again
	Oden with hair
	Dominayton
	Deandre Ayton
	Dominayton!
	That Greg???
	I guess
	Oops!
	Wizards &gt; Pistons &gt; no team at all &gt; Hornets
	Two minnows met, and they managed to score 175 points combined. Tragedy! Poor Hornets! Poor Trailblazers. Both teams have 38 wins combined whereas the Boston Celtics have 60 wins. How do you explain that??
	I was thinking portland resigned greg oden.
	Lazy bum DA
	DOMINANCE
	DA!
	Dominayton
	Blazers can’t even tank correctly
	Oden Redemption!
	Big woop
	 Dominayton
	Dominate-Ayton
