	 oh haha. Kind of true  though morant made a couple good dunks and everyone thinks he's the best lmao
	 his elevation is up there though. Boy is a walking highlight reel
	 Yeah, maybe if he was on a different team.He would make it to the championship lol
	This was a good game.
	Wizards will beating the Lakers coming game .Because Wizards home
	Lakers should ask Wizards for tips, lol!
	Sac just gave this game to them as a farewell gift for being not getting to the Play offs or even play in. 😅
	"This says... ""Weakest team can beat strongest team"".... Well that's basketball"
	How bad can you be to only win 12 games
	 also, how bad can one be to lose to a team with 11 wins? Kings are falling apart
	 kings are a donation team we like to give dubs to those in need.
	 wizards are terrible. As a fan I haven't seen a season this bad in my life. Kings have been losing to bad teams recently. When they play like they should.. they could play 3 nights in a row, miss sleep night prior to this game, be half drunk and still beat the wizards.
	 downgraded to the Queens. 😆
	Is Jordan pole averaging 40 like everyone thought? I've been in a coma

	They would’ve lost if they didn’t win
	Kings overated !!!!
	Huge upset beating the kings who’s trying to avoid a play in spot
	Should have been a Laker for life.
	before anybody reads too much into this, we lost to both the Spurs and the Pistons this season.
	cmon kuz you used to play at the same lvl with tatum back then
	 KUZMA 1 Nba Champion
	 Tatum is franchise player, all star, and USA starter , kuz is way behind
	Are the lakers that weak so much? That they lose to kings 4 straight and the kings lose to eliminated wizards lol
	Congrats Love!

	Go wizard.. they're 5 wins away to the play in
	Thanks kuzma for beating the queens
