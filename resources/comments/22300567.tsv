TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	This is Grayson Allen’s team. Kd and Book are great teammates. 😂
	 KD only wins when he is with stars such as Grayson Allen
	Grayson carried for 3quarters and KD brought it home in the 4th.
	Michelle Witman no
	Grayson Allen's shoulders must hurt for carrying this team over .500
	It’s time to start considering Durant a greater all time Forward than <a class=💯
	3rd straight wins for the <a class=
	Grayson better get a spot in the 3P contest. 🔥
	It's gonna be called the Big 4 pretty soon if Grayson keeps having the career year that he's having.
	I didn't watch the game cause it was a 16 point lead with half left in the 4th quarter. What a comeback😲😲😲
	Well done, KD!
	Great performance by grayson allen just because of experience in Milwaukee 😂
	"Grayson Allen is playing great, no question about that. He has been sinking wide open shots. But you all have to realize that he is getting wide open shots because they can't leave Booker, Beal and KD. Kudos to him though on making the best out of his … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Needs to win a championship besides those 2017, 2018 ones. Any of us here in the comments could have played with those guys.  But I think he needs to win one on this team.
	Mike Brown should be getting more from this group of players. Needs to sort things out or he’ll be out of a job soon. I like him, but he doesn’t know how to get us over the line.
	Grayson Allen to the Miami Heat. He got the heat culture.
	We gave that game up ...no len or Mcgee in the 4th  so no defense
	Left the game thinking suns were being blown out anyway... But that was some comeback.... I was shocked they won. Congrats suns....
	It was KD's defense, playing the small 5, and locking down Sabonis that won this game for the Suns.
	Grayson Allen best player in Suns this season
	Well done, Legend!🔥💪
	Legendary gift by refs
	It was Gordon two three points that light up the suns valley
	Best comeback win of the season.
	What a come back that was. KD 🔥 respect
	Durant is such a beast… very solid performances among Booker.
	GraySuns Allen ❤️
	Overshow and dominate, KD  what a comeback👏👏👏
	Win well deserved, thanks to very bad coaching decisions from the kings side! Broun need to be replaced immediately, if the kings want to win some playoffs games.
	Should not be happening to a so called great team in the West. Playing catch up ball! Ah ah 1st round exit come playoff
	Can someone get my man a brush or something! This is getting out of hand lmao 🤣
	Too difficult to win
	The best in the besness KD💯💪
	MIP grayson allen
	Let's Go Purok 12 👌
	Congrats! What a back!
	"I'm a Suns fan, why the F is KD on this post and not Grayson Allen?!! Better stats, literally without him we'd have been down by 50 in the 4th and this never happens. Only player to play 4 quarters. Love KD but NBA is a joke for creating this kind of m… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Beautiful 🤩.. 👏👏👏
	Y'all on here talking about Grayson Allen as if he not getting wide open shots from the attention the other three get hell. If I was Grayson getting the 4th or 5th best defender on me I would be cooking too 🤣
	They are 4 games over .500 who cares….all that talent to be average.
	They thought they had the Champ on the ropes. KD is a Killa!
	And did it with both Beal and Booker shooting bad
	Just to lose to OKC in the playoffs
	How much help needs what’s his excuse he don’t win this year lol
	Sun's found there Small Ball offense at 4th🏀💪
	even down by 22 at 4th Q, but we never give it up! Win as result 👏👏👏
	VERY NICE I LIKE IT
	Great
	Let’s Go!
	Choked kings lol back to back
	De’Aaron Fox: 33 PTS, 2 REB, 6 AST, 6PM
	Sabonis third triple double in a row
	Bout time he do some
	helping those in need, paying of their bills, debts and mortgages of the 5 first person that sends 🕊️
	Weird Grayson Allen coming through. The strangest place to get scoring but if they need a “big 4” so be it
	Yes!
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	4th qtr comeback!  
	Awesome, this is a superstar
	
	
	
	
	
	❤️👏
	Looks like Grayson was the MVP of that game...KD just did what KD was suppose to do from the start 🤦‍♂️ 
	Y'all believe these games are real😂😂😂😂😂😂
	Grayson carried for 3quarters and KD brought it home in the 4th.
	Sacramento Back to Back Choked!
	Hiphopthreekings. New york
	Sabonis 💚🏀
