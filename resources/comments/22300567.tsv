TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHX	This is Grayson Allen’s team. Kd and Book are great teammates. 😂
PHX	Donjoe Lampe KD only wins when he is with stars such as Grayson Allen
PHX	Grayson carried for 3quarters and KD brought it home in the 4th.
	Michelle Witman no
PHX	Grayson Allen's shoulders must hurt for carrying this team over .500
PHX	Grayson better get a spot in the 3P contest. 🔥
PHX	3rd straight wins for the #suns!!! what a run by the suns in the 4th, down by 20 under 8 mins, and they fight back to get the win! 🙂
PHX	It’s time to start considering Durant a greater all time Forward than #Lebron 💯💯
PHX	Well done, KD!
	Chris Paynter hello
PHX	It's gonna be called the Big 4 pretty soon if Grayson keeps having the career year that he's having.
PHX	I didn't watch the game cause it was a 16 point lead with half left in the 4th quarter. What a comeback😲😲😲
PHX	Great performance by grayson allen just because of experience in Milwaukee 😂
PHX	Grayson Allen is playing great, no question about that. He has been sinking wide open shots. But you all have to realize that he is getting wide open shots because they can't leave Booker, Beal and KD. Kudos to him though on making the best out of his playing time. Awesome shooter!
PHX	Chester Buagas he's doing more than sinking open shots dude..you know he's doing everything on defence, driving and cutting, passing out of the lane. He's doing as much as the big name players for sure.
	Needs to win a championship besides those 2017, 2018 ones. Any of us here in the comments could have played with those guys.  But I think he needs to win one on this team.
	Mike Brown should be getting more from this group of players. Needs to sort things out or he’ll be out of a job soon. I like him, but he doesn’t know how to get us over the line.
PHX	It was KD's defense, playing the small 5, and locking down Sabonis that won this game for the Suns.
PHX	Grayson Allen to the Miami Heat. He got the heat culture.
PHX	Left the game thinking suns were being blown out anyway... But that was some comeback.... I was shocked they won. Congrats suns....
SAC	We gave that game up ...no len or Mcgee in the 4th  so no defense
PHX	Grayson Allen best player in Suns this season
PHX	Win well deserved, thanks to very bad coaching decisions from the kings side! Broun need to be replaced immediately, if the kings want to win some playoffs games.
PHX	It was Gordon two three points that light up the suns valley
PHX	Legendary gift by refs
PHX	Durant is such a beast… very solid performances among Booker.
PHX	What a come back that was. KD 🔥 respect
PHX	Well done, Legend!🔥💪
PHX	Overshow and dominate, KD  what a comeback👏👏👏
PHX	Can someone get my man a brush or something! This is getting out of hand lmao 🤣
PHX	Best comeback win of the season.
PHX	Should not be happening to a so called great team in the West. Playing catch up ball! Ah ah 1st round exit come playoff
	GraySuns Allen ❤️
PHX	Too difficult to win
PHX	The best in the besness KD💯💪
PHX	MIP grayson allen
	Let's Go Purok 12 👌
PHX	Congrats! What a back!
PHX	Beautiful 🤩.. 👏👏👏
PHX	I'm a Suns fan, why the F is KD on this post and not Grayson Allen?!! Better stats, literally without him we'd have been down by 50 in the 4th and this never happens. Only player to play 4 quarters. Love KD but NBA is a joke for creating this kind of media culture where only certain players get hype. It doesn't work outside of America. Everywhere else in the world it's a team game so try to grow the game a bit and increase the following.
PHX	Y'all on here talking about Grayson Allen as if he not getting wide open shots from the attention the other three get hell. If I was Grayson getting the 4th or 5th best defender on me I would be cooking too 🤣
PHX	They thought they had the Champ on the ropes. KD is a Killa!
	They are 4 games over .500 who cares….all that talent to be average.
	How much help needs what’s his excuse he don’t win this year lol
	And did it with both Beal and Booker shooting bad
PHX	Just to lose to OKC in the playoffs
	even down by 22 at 4th Q, but we never give it up! Win as result 👏👏👏
PHX	Sun's found there Small Ball offense at 4th🏀💪
PHX	VERY NICE I LIKE IT
PHX	Great
PHX	Let’s Go!
SAC	Choked kings lol back to back
	De’Aaron Fox: 33 PTS, 2 REB, 6 AST, 6PM
SAC	Spence Fenrir they lost cause of him, foul Durant on the last play, ball hog near the end
PHX	Jack Ky stats don’t lie though. Still the top performer of the game.
	Spence Fenrir doesn't it matter when you lost the game, it's like winning an MVP but lost the game.
	Jack Ky he was the best on court and they left his stats out.
	Spence Fenrir don't matter, he ball hog, that's why he scored all those points
	Jack Ky ok well his stats do the talking
	Spence Fenrir he was not the best dude, he ball hog that's why he scored all those points, they lost cause of him near the end, same goes when they played the Bucks, to watch the highlight dude
	Sabonis third triple double in a row
	Bout time he do some
	"helping those in need, paying of their bills, debts and mortgages of the 5 first person that sends ""GOD NEVER FAIL""🤎🕊️"
PHX	Weird Grayson Allen coming through. The strangest place to get scoring but if they need a “big 4” so be it
PHX	Yes!
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
PHX	4th qtr comeback! #RallyTheValley #GoSuns
PHX	Awesome, this is a superstar
