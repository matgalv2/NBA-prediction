TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I hope they win the championship because if they don’t, all that for nothing.
	Boston Celtic will be the 2024 NBA Champion
	Thank you Celtics. 
	Gerald Kagaoan lol, we be scoreboard watching now. Tied for 5th now.
	🤣.
	🤔
	Alex Bendana it will be by record i think?
	Gerald Kagaoan yes, but if they end up with same record, and a season series of 2-2, they must go by more conference wins or division wins I’m assuming.
	Great Win For The Celtics 💚🤍 On The Road
	All fun and games until Jaylen Brown suddenly forgets how to dribble the basketball using his left hand 😩😭💀🤣
	🔥🔥
	That’s dope they been balling all year.. Besides Denver they the most complete team.. Heat in 5
	Yep, and won't mean jack if they lose to Denver...or even the heat...again.
	All these regular season wins and will likely get bounced first or second round lmao
	Let’s win the nba championship this year
	Tatum for the team
	Our defense hasn't looked good the last couple games 🍀
	Heat just aren’t the same this year. Celtics could actually takem in 5 I think.
