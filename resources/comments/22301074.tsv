	Boston Celtic will be the 2024 NBA Champion
	 fool
	Thank you Celtics. 
	 I'm Mavs fan too. Thank you.☺️
	 lol, we be scoreboard watching now. Tied for 5th now.
	 big thank you celtics
	Great Win For The Celtics 💚🤍 On The Road
	All fun and games until Jaylen Brown suddenly forgets how to dribble the basketball using his left hand 😩😭💀🤣
	Facts and Tatum chokes when it matters. 🤣
	They not winning 💩💩there soft
	I only wait for the play-off games and see if they are contenders or pretenders again.
	That’s dope they been balling all year.. Besides Denver they the most complete team.. Heat in 5
	All these regular season wins and will likely get bounced first or second round lmao
	 Yeah that's why the Celtics have been in 5 of the last 7 ECFs and an NBA Finals during that time, just say you don't watch💯
	 literally has never happened in the Jays era with them leading the charge and healthy but sure lol
	 Guess you don't watch the playoffs,  they haven't been bounced in the 1st round since 2016.
	 This is the stupidest take I’ve ever heard
	 that’s just objectively wrong lmao just say you’re a Celtics hater
	 in your dreams you forgot that they are always in  confernce finals
	
	Yep, and won't mean jack if they lose to Denver...or even the heat...again.
	Tatum for the team
	Our defense hasn't looked good the last couple games 🍀

	Heat just aren’t the same this year. Celtics could actually takem in 5 I think.
	 yup!
	The Lakers are going to Bust their bubble! I gonna watch it happen!!!!
	3 more games needed to get Top seed in the league and home court during the playoffs.
	Boston ❤️❤️❤️❤️
	It's championship or burst .
	Boston Celtics Vs New Orleans Pelicans
	2 yrs in a row. Chokletics
	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪
	Heat is waving 👋 😂

	 Baka matalo pa sa play in ang heat hehehe
	Will sure be a shame when they bow out 1st or second round lol.
	 that hasn’t happened since when? I’ll wait lmao
	 Okay, okay. Maybe not first round 😂 I kid, I kid...
	 yup  lmao🤣 😎
	Ang boston parang di mag cha champ ata meron kasing laker na tatalo sa at kng sakali man boston vs nuggets ahm like wise b4 nuggets ang mag cha champion
	 The Lakers are a guaranteed second round exit, or a conference Finals exit to say the least
	 manood nlang tayo ng laban kng sini mag cha champ sa iniidilo nating mga team
	 trabaho kasi nla yang nba
	Let's go Celtics🍀🍀 make it 60
	Last 8 games pa Ang Celtics at 58 wins sila ngayon
	Denver vs Celtics magandang match up sa NBA Finals..
	Go Pelicans
	Nice move regular season champ we'll see in the playoffs
	"Jayson ""The Titanium"" Tatum"

	Let's get to 62. That was my prediction early in the season
	 They’re definitely going to surpass that. They’re going to end up somewhere between 64 and 66 wins
	 my wife thinks 66. I don't think so. I think the starting 6 will sit out the last week of the season. I'm guessing 3 or 4 games will be scheduled during that last week
	 Regardless of where they finish in the regular season, 16 is the magic number in the Playoffs. Hopefully they can get it done this year ☘️
	 let's pray they are healthy. If they are, they win the chip
	I heard the whole 
	All this Just to choke in the playoffs again😂🥱
	 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐩👍👍
	Second round exit.
	And they still won't win the chip
	Didn't choke at all, nice🔥🔥🔥
