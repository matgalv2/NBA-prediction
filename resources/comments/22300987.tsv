	NBA better start showing Wolves games on the regular nationally next season because Ant is about to be the face of the league.
	 for fuck sake.  Everyone thinks their favorite player is the face of the league
	 Name another 22 year old doing what he’s doing.
	 LeBron James that kid has something special
	 LeBron is 38
	 That's ridiculous
	who cares ???  And I’m not disrespecting Edward’s. Kids amazing. But we see young guys every year putting up numbers so to be the face of the league takes way more than that. Especially when he plays for the wolves. They’re one of the red headed step children teams of the nba that hasn’t been relevant since KG. Wolves could legit win 2-3 titles in the next few years and nobody would give a shit. 
	 🥴
	 I care. Wolves haven’t had anything for decades. Nobody wants to shine a light on us or even Ant. That shit needs to stop. Screw the big market teams.
	 All the NBA greats are saying the same thing HATER!!!
	 Blah blah blah. Ant is the only 3 level scorer that is also one of the best defenders in the game. He's electric and exciting to watch. A lot of NBA players are saying the same. He gets better every year and had MN #1 for damn near the whole season. Ironically the guys you names said Ant .an will be the face of the league. You're a hater and Ant is 3 years younger than Luka and Tatum...
	 stop it 😂😂😂😂😂. Funny it’s wolves fans caping for dude. Like no shit.
	 I mean a few titles might do that otherwise the wolves will always just he the wolves and some 40-50 win seasons or a playoff series win isn’t going to get that done.
	 and I gave dude his flowers. I literally said he’s amazing.  Problem is wolves are mostly an obscure small market team. And there is a ton of talent in the league now and will be in the future.  There’s a ton to pick from.
	 Ant is 22 though. That’s the difference. And he’s already top 10.
	 don’t watch basketball.  Maybe you need to subscribe TNT, or any sports
	  you don’t have tV channel or you don’t  have cable
	 yes. Go wolves 🐺🐺🐺
	The more I see of this young, athletic player... The more I believe the hype about him.... WOW 😳
	 hello 👋
	The ANTH-Man 2
	 hello 👋
	Superstar is waving
	Kong makarating sa playoffs ang lakers yan sana gusto ko makalaban ng lakers
	All these Haters in the comments mad. Knowing if he was on their team they wouldn't be down playing this 22 year old 2 way player.
	Ant’s dunk Def a more exciting dunk to see than Jaylen Brown’s sneeze slam 😤😩😭💀🤣
	Anthony edwards is a iverson/jordan hybrid.
	 D.Wade at best.
	32 points Anthony Edwards
	Micheal Jordan  ??
