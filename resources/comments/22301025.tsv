	 Investments are very necessity , making it early is important yeah true. But what's better is having a company that guarantees maximum risk of losing. And there you have these platform 
	 that’s normally the case when introducing a new talent. They don’t know how to play with him and the organization is trying to figure out what they have.
	 I mean that's individual award 'tho? And it is ROOKIE of the year not MVP. It's the best rookie to the draft class, not the best rookie in the best team. The would be Most valuable rookie 🤷🏼‍♂️
	 typical casual comment. lol

	Spurs have no consistent shooters. Bad drafts and signings. Statistically significantly bad drafts. They need to make some signings during the off season.
	Great!
	Clam down, it's San Antonio 🤣
	Congratulations

	Why did Booker always choke in playoff clutch games? He is amazing in season games...
	 he's been DOMINATED in last playoff wym
	 too soft against Mavericks /Nuggets /Bucks...in clutch games
	 bro did you not see what he was doing to the nuggets and the clippers in the playoffs last year😭bro was going stupid crazy
	 Overwhelmed by pressure
	 Booker averages 28 pts, 5 rebs, 5 assists across three playoff runs. Last season, he averaged 33 pts, 5 revs and 7 assists.
	That smile.😁
