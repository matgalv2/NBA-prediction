MIN	Wolves is playing same game as clippers in Technics. Clippers need to play young talent and rest this old guys Everytime they play wolves. Change the speed for wolves by playing coffeey and Mann and any other young player
	Givanni Juma Hello 👋

	Givanni Juma Still ain't gonna matter 🤣 wolves are just better
LAC	Dakota Heaton there gotta be a way. Wolves might cost us a championship. beat us by 20points is crazy .while we got everyone in even zu.
MIN	the wolves is like the upgraded 2004 pistons, should at least enter western conference final this year.
	Yin Lai Hello 👋 
LAC	Where those clippers fans at that think they bout to win it all 🤣🤣🥱🗑️
MIN	Congrats!!! Minnesota TimberWolves TEAM!!!
MIN	As big as a wolves fan as I am.  They have showed signs of this all year.  But than they will come back and blow a lead against a garbage team.  They need to finish games, and the ball has to be in Ant or Connelys hands in the 4th
	Warriors on their way to the championship 🥰🥰
	Joson Baice the Warriors are the 10 seed.
	Cullen Heimer and? Still heap of games left

MIN	Congrats!!! Minnesota TimberWolves TEAM!!!
	Timberwolves stopped both of Clippers win streaks lol
	Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Ante Boban Wolvesi nastavljaju da maltretiraju Clipperse, ostaje Clipsima jedna pobjeda od 2021. Ja ti kažem Wolvesi su opasna ekipa i niko nije favorit protiv njih, pa ni Clippersi koje razbiju snagom i pod obručem a itekako im i s vana imaju odgovor.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović nisam gledao..
	Ante Boban Svi visoki igrači Wolvesa dvoznamenkasti bili. KAT, Gobert, Reid, McDaniels, plus pokupili više skokova, a Kawhi ništa nije mogao KAT-u, KAT ga samo unosio pod obruč i završavao posao.
	Ante Boban ps - Zubac, Theis i Plumlee skupa zabili 6 p i uhvatili 13 sk.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović nisu ni igrali mnogo..To i je greška Luea..
	T shaata dwards!!!!
MIN	Ant needs to improve his fg %
MIN	Les Siem Ant shooting isn't bad. He gets fouled a lot and sometimes have off games but still picks up in other parts of his game. Also he's double and trippled a lot of the game. He's 22 and learning.
	Romey Rome 
	What I tell you next to Portland yeah we going on a fighting game winning streak in the championship Hollaback back at
	HOW MANY coaches have been ejected this year already, HOW MANY coaches have been fined. The NBA has ZERO INTREGITY. 
MIN	Clippers fans after the first Wolves match up: Y'all only won because we didn't have Zubac.
	Josh Voigt HELLO 👋 
	Josh Voigt They need more superstars😂😂
	Josh Voigt hahaha that’s what I’m saying😂 it was worse with Zubac🤣
	Josh Voigtlost because Zubac played instead of Plumlee😉
MIN	Minnesota looking scary clippers still in 5 in the playoffs
	just make sure katt stays hard and we good
	1st round exit mark my word hahaha
	Kong nanalo lang kanina ang clippers marahil sila nasa top 1 now sa west
	AL Prince matik yan boss ayun nga pinaglabanan nila ...
	AL Prince malakas ang wolves
	Klaro na ayaw manalo ni lue.
MIN	The question is, can the Timberwolves replicate the performances they've been putting in when the playoffs gets under way???
	like it

	Why the hell photos today looks like it's taken from a potato? Everybody looks blurry.
	Win easily even with Ant going 1-11 from long.  If this kid could shoot look out.
	David Wippich he can shoot had a bad night
	David Wippich Lol he can shoot...just had a bad night from deep.
	I can't wait to see the standings at the end of the season.
