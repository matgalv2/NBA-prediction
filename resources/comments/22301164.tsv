TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DEN	That's how it is when DPOY guards you. No triple doubles, and that's less than 50points congratulations to Gober.
DEN	Milan Ivanov Jokic only shot 16/20 (80%), the Rudy Gobert effect.
	🙂
MIN	The altitude really messes with you and makes you super fatigued. I played college hockey traveling to Colorado and playing is hard. Try doing that on a back to back in the NBA if you aren’t used to it. That’s not fair.
DEN	great game. Jokic remained the best player in the nba. R. Jackson should be out of the rotation.
	Yuval Ben-Noun he will be out of the rotation I believe next season when strawther takes his place as the back up pg. I am excited about the future team also.
DEN	DEN vs GSW in the 1st round. WARRIORS IN 6!!! MARK MY WORDS 🤷🏻‍♂️
	Take that L on the way out!  😤
MIN	Sean Three's they snuck by a Wolves team playing on a back to back having to travel to Denver, without KAT, relax.
	Topher
DEN	Jokic wins countless games for the nuggets, crazy
	They still need to give the mvp to luka
DEN	THAT'S HOW MVP's DOES IT 💯🔥
DEN	Bro got tom brady combine measurements and is just giving the league busy work.
	Byron Robusky Jr. When you play on the pavement until age of 15 you realize that 1. You dont need to highfly 2. That highflying on the pavement hurts like a lot
DEN	It's absolutely insane how much illegal violations he gets away with.  I saw at least 6-8 fouls he should have been called for and didn't.  He had 2 lane violations last night on free throws that were completely ignored.  Tony Brothers was definitely on the take last night.  Only possible explanation for the gross incompetence is that he was paid to do it.
DEN	It's crazy how many offensive fouls he doesn't get called for. The refs are letting him get away with everything and I've first noticed this years ago.
DEN	These teams like Nuggets or Wolves have been so lucky this season.
DEN	He is not a highlight reel waiting to happen but he gets the job done. People hate him because he is not athletic nor ripped and he puts those who are to shame. The NBA doesn't market his kind.
DEN	41pts in 80%FG against the DPOY and the best defensive team is wild! 🔥
MIN	Zaguetth Cabonce Rudy Gobert is not the defense of player to year. In fact, his defense is highly overrated. He's not even that good of a defensive player. You're trying to overrate the man. Now let's talk about jokics defense, can we talk about his de… Wyświetl więcej
	Sean Kerrigan Yow who's trying to debate you? I was just stating his stats that is wild. You are talking about his defense right? he got 3 steals and couple of defensive rebounds. But we all know he is not that good shot blocker coz he can't jump.  I never said Jokic is a good defender in my comment. I was just saying his stats was wild. But if you wanna bring up defense, Jokic is top 5 in defensive rating. But for sure he is not a good shot blocker. 
MIN	Congrats refs you outplayed the Wolves! Nuggets were there to support them.
DEN	There’s a reason he’s the first pick in every fantasy basketball draft 👆🏻
DEN	it's the plus minus efficiency that wins Jokic the MVP. Luka can outshoot Jokic all day but Jokic FGM to FGA ratio and assists and rebounds are much better than Luka.
DEN	He is the real MVP
DEN	Sealed the deal with another MVP . Impressive
DEN	There is your MVP ladies and gents 👏🏼
	If the Lakers can advance to the playoffs, their run will be short-lived if they face Denver in the 1st round.
DEN	Best center in the league
DEN	"I still repeat nobody this season can guard ""Nikola Jokic"" 🔥🏀 let's go Denver Nuggets"
	If nobody can stop this man then we’re looking at back to back chip.
DEN	Awesome 👏 as always the Joker was on
	A back-to-back title is within the Nuggets' reach. It would be difficult to beat them in a best-of-seven series.
MIN	As a Celtics fan this is the team to beat and Jokic is just another beast altogether
DEN	He actually looks like the Joker
MIN	"Gober:"" I got him """
DEN	if jokic still can elevates , I'll take him over shaq
	Hope it's these two in the Western Conference Finals
DEN	this guy going to win another ring
DEN	He's the MVP
DEN	Jokic way stronger than AD
DEN	Nikola Jokic is the goat hands down!!!! Mr. MVP
DEN	Jokic is the best
DEN	Let's go Denver
DEN	What a game! ❤️🏀
DEN	Good job
DEN	Denver is getting knocked out by the Celtics
	These two teams don’t wanna face GS or LAL in the 1st round.
DEN	How is this guy not the MVP? (genuinely asking)
DEN	Congratulations my nuggets Nation hello my love 🤣🤣🤣 guys championship repeat coming soon 🏆 promise good luck to you all babe 🙏🙏🙏
DEN	I love that it’s a MVP battle between Jokic and Luka and the American players are a distant afterthought 😎
	Veli Djurdjevic happy now
	👍
DEN	Joker  killers smile
DEN	Congrats Nuggets, excellent performance by Jokic with his 66th double-doubles this season. MVP 2024, the best center and the best player right now.
	With the help of NBA referees. Just like what Charles Barkley said “if fans found out that it’s rigged”.
DEN	Nikola Jokic is the 2024 NBA Most Valuable Player
MIN	Goberts father
DEN	Nuggets back to back champ
DEN	Go go Denver!
DEN	Jokic MVP ❤️❤️❤️
DEN	I’m jus gonna say it now, this man and his team stay healthy, nuggets will 3peat
DEN	Dude really looks like some kinda Joker 😂😂😂😂
DEN	I hope my celts wouldn't meet em in the finals...such a beast team
DEN	4th MVP this year 💪
DEN	We are the Defending Champion and I am the reigning finals MVP. I will win my 3rd regular season MVP this season
DEN	I dont care what anyone says..joker is probably the best center ever to play basketball and its flashy or anything thats why alot of blm movement hates him
DEN	The best ❤️ let’s go nuggets!!👏🏼👍🏼
DEN	Who gives a f about these, Kevin Hart say he ain't deserve it. Kevin is 3 times all star's MVP, how many Jokic has?! 0
DEN	Back to back championship
DEN	Luka and SGA have had incredible seasons but I think Jokic sealed the MVP with this performance. Made a great defender like Gobert look so ordinary.
DEN	MVP!!! 🏆
DEN	What a,player  😍
DEN	That YT boa can hoop!
DEN	Well he may have secured his MVP.
DEN	Jokic could be the best scorer in the league if he wanted.
DEN	After all, the best player on the other side is just well, an ANT🙄
	Should've been 4th str8t mvp this year. Best player in the world
	Gilberto Sanchez are you for real? He good but not that good
DEN	"Jesus Miguel Gonzalezhe's reining champion and finals mvp. Compare his offensive stats in the last 4 years to any other player and he is the best. I used to think the same, he ain't ""that"" good but his play, stats and Winning say otherwise"
	Officially became the jump ball meme
DEN	The Best big man in the NBA
DEN	JOKIC VS WEMBANAYAMA 42 PS TRIPPLE DOUBLE
DEN	Stop putting him where he doesn't belong among the best centers in NBA history he would be  embarrassed.
DEN	His MVP award is secured!
DEN	Jokic#MVP of the season #tripple double
	Ant Edwards just disappeared after the game😃Congrats 🎉💪🫶
	Promotion to Promotion
	It’s gonna be a fun playoffs! A lot of upsets!! Warriors will most likely win the 2024 NBA Championship
MIN	Look  regular season  does  mean anything  it's  playoffs  wolves  isn't  going  to win  a championship  not this year  or next year Edward's  just  going. To end up been a good player
DEN	Still, it's Denver time.Winning for 2nd straight NBA title..No any other Team from the West capable to beat the Nuggets this season.
DEN	The real MVP!!💍⛹️
MIN	Finally the Wolves dropped a point 😊
	Nooooooo, Arenas said that was the worst MVP ever, what an intelligent men that Gilbert 🙄
DEN	What's up with the NBA? What have the game of basketball come to? The joker could have never keep up with the show time Lakers back in the days. How can a NBA player as slow as the joker do so much damage in an NBA game?
DEN	Until  someone  in nba get physical with  the jokic  they not going  to beat the nuggets  Dwight Howard  got physical  with him that why lakers  won the championship
DEN	Denver nuggets 2024 nba champions💪
DEN	Best center ever
DEN	They still have a few games left before they actually clinch the West.
DEN	Great game Nuggets 💕
DEN	Mvp 3
DEN	The true non-self proclaimed king!
DEN	Denver with Jokic = Champions
DEN	Big win for the tie break 🏀
DEN	He's  incredible!
MIN	Timberwolf will struggle for championship with whole team healthy, Nuggets show it now
DEN	Jokic makes scoring looks so easy that one loses track of the totals he rings up.
	warriors ko pre apeke akung team
DEN	He doesn’t deserve mvp ever
	Lucky Karl Anthony towns was out, otherwise the story will be different 🐺 SOTA
DEN	Future MVP bet locked since they robbed him last year should be 4 in a row
	Superstars shine in the last few minutes of the game, cant deny Jokic is the MVP.
DEN	I love this team!!!
DEN	People forget the Wolves are without their 2nd  leading scorer KAT and have been number 1 in the West most of the season. KAT will be back! Without Jamal Murray the Nuggets fans cry and can’t win without him. It’s sad really. They have no depth to them at all. 😂
MIN	Just like that they snatched it out of the wolves hands smh
	Luka - MVP, the Nuggets will win the chip. Boston still chokes
DEN	Jokic eats this team alive
DEN	Well done #nikolajokic🙏🙏👏👏🌟🌟💫💫🇦🇺🙌💯💯
	i have got him
DEN	Nuggets in 5
	Either way, a West team is winning the finals.
	His game is boring to watch I don’t care what you say….
	solid ka talaga Clark Roque
	The battle of Jokic God vs  Ant mortal!
	Offensive magician and underrated defender.
	Payton Watson has 6 blocks! 13 over the last 3 games!!
	thats a confident evil smile right there 😆.

DEN	Your MVP right here
DEN	His people loving these moments 😎

	Go Nicola make another sweep HAHA
	Joker just sealed the deal for his 3rd MVP.

DEN	Nuggies are going to repeat
	Still haven’t had kat
DEN	Mvp
DEN	3 steals? But he doesn't play any defense.
	Special real special looking.
	Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Denver Nuggets
DEN	That's a great picture of you and God bless you😇🙏
DEN	Nuggets dominate!!!
DEN	Only voter's fatigue will prevent him from his 3rd MVP.
	MvpBig15💪🏽🕶️👔👞👞🏅🏅🏅🏅🏀💛💙💛💙🌟🌟🌟🌟👏🏽😃❤
DEN	Amazing game. Nuggets were definitely the better team.
DEN	Joker szef
DEN	Back to back champion 🏆🏆🏆🏆💪
