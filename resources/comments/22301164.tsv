	That's how it is when DPOY guards you. No triple doubles, and that's less than 50points congratulations to Gober.
	 Jokic only shot 16/20 (80%), the Rudy Gobert effect.
	The altitude really messes with you and makes you super fatigued. I played college hockey traveling to Colorado and playing is hard. Try doing that on a back to back in the NBA if you aren’t used to it. That’s not fair.
	great game. Jokic remained the best player in the nba. R. Jackson should be out of the rotation.
	 he will be out of the rotation I believe next season when strawther takes his place as the back up pg. I am excited about the future team also.
	Take that L on the way out!  😤
	DEN vs GSW in the 1st round. WARRIORS IN 6!!! MARK MY WORDS 🤷🏻‍♂️
	They still need to give the mvp to luka
	Jokic wins countless games for the nuggets, crazy
	THAT'S HOW MVP's DOES IT 💯🔥
	Bro got tom brady combine measurements and is just giving the league busy work.
	"It's absolutely insane how much illegal violations he gets away with.  I saw at least 6-8 fouls he should have been called for and didn't.  He had 2 lane violations last night on free throws that were completely ignored.  Tony Brothers was definitely o… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	These teams like Nuggets or Wolves have been so lucky this season.
	It's crazy how many offensive fouls he doesn't get called for. The refs are letting him get away with everything and I've first noticed this years ago.
	He is not a highlight reel waiting to happen but he gets the job done. People hate him because he is not athletic nor ripped and he puts those who are to shame. The NBA doesn't market his kind.
	41pts in 80%FG against the DPOY and the best defensive team is wild! 🔥
	He is the real MVP
	There’s a reason he’s the first pick in every fantasy basketball draft 👆🏻
	Congrats refs you outplayed the Wolves! Nuggets were there to support them.
	it's the plus minus efficiency that wins Jokic the MVP. Luka can outshoot Jokic all day but Jokic FGM to FGA ratio and assists and rebounds are much better than Luka.
	There is your MVP ladies and gents 👏🏼
	Sealed the deal with another MVP . Impressive
	If the Lakers can advance to the playoffs, their run will be short-lived if they face Denver in the 1st round.
	Best center in the league
	Awesome 👏 as always the Joker was on 
	If nobody can stop this man then we’re looking at back to back chip.
	He actually looks like the Joker
	A back-to-back title is within the Nuggets' reach. It would be difficult to beat them in a best-of-seven series.
	As a Celtics fan this is the team to beat and Jokic is just another beast altogether
	Nikola Jokic is the goat hands down!!!! Mr. MVP
	if jokic still can elevates , I'll take him over shaq
	I still repeat nobody this season can guard 🏀 let's go 
	"Gober:"" I got him """
	Jokic way stronger than AD
	Hope it's these two in the Western Conference Finals
	He's the MVP
	Jokic is the best
	this guy going to win another ring
	Let's go Denver
	Good job
	Denver is getting knocked out by the Celtics
	How is this guy not the MVP? (genuinely asking)
	These two teams don’t wanna face GS or LAL in the 1st round.
	I love that it’s a MVP battle between Jokic and Luka and the American players are a distant afterthought 😎
	Congratulations my nuggets Nation hello my love 🤣🤣🤣 guys championship repeat coming soon 🏆 promise good luck to you all babe 🙏🙏🙏
	Joker  killers smile
	Congrats Nuggets, excellent performance by Jokic with his 66th double-doubles this season. MVP 2024, the best center and the best player right now.
	With the help of  referees. Just like what Charles Barkley said “if fans found out that it’s rigged”.
	Nikola Jokic is the 2024 NBA Most Valuable Player
	Goberts father
	Nuggets back to back champ
	What a game! ❤️🏀
	Go go Denver!
	Jokic MVP ❤️❤️❤️
	I’m jus gonna say it now, this man and his team stay healthy, nuggets will 3peat
	Dude really looks like some kinda Joker 😂😂😂😂
	I hope my celts wouldn't meet em in the finals...such a beast team
	4th MVP this year 💪
	We are the Defending Champion and I am the reigning finals MVP. I will win my 3rd regular season MVP this season
	I dont care what anyone says..joker is probably the best center ever to play basketball and its flashy or anything thats why alot of blm movement hates him
	The best ❤️ let’s go nuggets!!👏🏼👍🏼
	Who gives a f about these, Kevin Hart say he ain't deserve it. Kevin is 3 times all star's MVP, how many Jokic has?! 0
	Back to back championship
	Luka and SGA have had incredible seasons but I think Jokic sealed the MVP with this performance. Made a great defender like Gobert look so ordinary.
	MVP!!! 🏆
	What a,player  😍
	That YT boa can hoop!
	Well he may have secured his MVP.
	Jokic could be the best scorer in the league if he wanted.
	After all, the best player on the other side is just well, an ANT🙄
	Should've been 4th str8t mvp this year. Best player in the world
	Officially became the jump ball meme
	The Best big man in the NBA
	JOKIC VS WEMBANAYAMA 42 PS TRIPPLE DOUBLE 
	Stop putting him where he doesn't belong among the best centers in NBA history he would be  embarrassed.
	His MVP award is secured!
	Jokic#MVP of the season  double
	Ant Edwards just disappeared after the game😃Congrats  to repeat🎉💪🫶
	Promotion to Promotion
	It’s gonna be a fun playoffs! A lot of upsets!! Warriors will most likely win the 2024 NBA Championship
	Look  regular season  does  mean anything  it's  playoffs  wolves  isn't  going  to win  a championship  not this year  or next year Edward's  just  going. To end up been a good player
	Still, it's Denver time.Winning for 2nd straight NBA title..No any other Team from the West capable to beat the Nuggets this season.
	The real MVP!!💍⛹️
	Finally the Wolves dropped a point 😊
	Nooooooo, Arenas said that was the worst MVP ever, what an intelligent men that Gilbert 🙄
	What's up with the NBA? What have the game of basketball come to? The joker could have never keep up with the show time Lakers back in the days. How can a NBA player as slow as the joker do so much damage in an NBA game?
	Until  someone  in nba get physical with  the jokic  they not going  to beat the nuggets  Dwight Howard  got physical  with him that why lakers  won the championship
	Denver nuggets 2024 nba champions💪
	Best center ever
	They still have a few games left before they actually clinch the West.
	Great game Nuggets 💕
	Mvp 3
	The true non-self proclaimed king! 
	Denver with Jokic = Champions
	Big win for the tie break 🏀
	He's  incredible!
	Timberwolf will struggle for championship with whole team healthy, Nuggets show it now
	Jokic makes scoring looks so easy that one loses track of the totals he rings up.
	warriors ko pre apeke akung team
	He doesn’t deserve mvp ever
	Lucky Karl Anthony towns was out, otherwise the story will be different 🐺 SOTA
	Future MVP bet locked since they robbed him last year should be 4 in a row
	Superstars shine in the last few minutes of the game, cant deny Jokic is the MVP.
	I love this team!!!
	People forget the Wolves are without their 2nd  leading scorer KAT and have been number 1 in the West most of the season. KAT will be back! Without Jamal Murray the Nuggets fans cry and can’t win without him. It’s sad really. They have no depth to them at all. 😂
	Just like that they snatched it out of the wolves hands smh
	Luka - MVP, the Nuggets will win the chip. Boston still chokes
	Jokic eats this team alive
	Well done <a class=🙏👏👏🌟🌟💫💫🇦🇺🙌💯💯
	i have got him
	Nuggets in 5
	Either way, a West team is winning the finals.
	His game is boring to watch I don’t care what you say….
	solid ka talaga 
	The battle of Jokic God vs  Ant mortal!
	Offensive magician and underrated defender.
	Payton Watson has 6 blocks! 13 over the last 3 games!!
	thats a confident evil smile right there 😆.
	They’re 100% gonna Repeat! 🏆 🏆
	Your MVP right here
	His people loving these moments 😎
	He's a beast 🃏 💪
	Go Nicola make another sweep HAHA
	Joker just sealed the deal for his 3rd MVP.
	Mvp.
	Back 2 back Champs baby!!!!
	He got that joker smile
	Nuggies are going to repeat
	Still haven’t had kat
	Mvp
	3 steals? But he doesn't play any defense. 
	Special real special looking.
	Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Denver Nuggets
	That's a great picture of you and God bless you😇🙏
	Nuggets dominate!!!
	Only voter's fatigue will prevent him from his 3rd MVP.
	MvpBig15💪🏽🕶️👔👞👞🏅🏅🏅🏅🏀💛💙💛💙🌟🌟🌟🌟👏🏽😃❤
	Amazing game. Nuggets were definitely the better team.
	Joker szef
	Back to back champion 🏆🏆🏆🏆💪
	Another Good Victory For The Nuggets
	If KAT didn't go down, idk if this happens. Here we are
