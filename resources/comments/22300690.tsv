	Phoenix Suns Vs Atlanta Hawks
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
ATL	Great Win For The Hawks Thanks To Trae Young's 32 Point Performance
ATL	With 7 turnovers and a +/- of -1. If he could clean up his decision making, people would have to talk about him as one of, if not, the best PG in the game right now. But, that’s been his achilles heel his whole career so it’s probably not going to improve.
ATL	Sports Nonsense and Whiskey he is a sloppy chucker, facts
ATL	Sports Nonsense and Whiskey 15 asst and 7 TO , that’s a 2/1 ratio that’s great smh 🤦🏾 that’s a great Achilles heel
	Darnell Kirkpatrick agreed. Just my opinion on why he’s not considered as a top dog. It’s being critical and nitpicking, but I can’t see any other reason why he’s not at the top of the list right now.
	Sports Nonsense and Whiskey funny how no one talks about Luka having the second highest turnover rate in the NBA. Maybe if Luka cleaned up his decision making he would’ve made the playoffs last year!
	Stephen Quarles funny how I didn’t mention or compare him to any other player. Just stated why I believe he’s not considered elite.
	Sports Nonsense and Whiskey and I made a comparison to someone in the league with a similar turnover rate. Just goes to show how some stats are overlooked for certain players
	Stephen Quarles okay, fair. I’d argue that the stat line Trae had is fairly common for him. Not as much for Luka. But, they are closer than people want to believe, at times.
ATL	AWESOME
	All Star is nothing nowdays. It just a popularity contest. 😌
ATL	Best defensive performance by young ive seen.
PHX	Josh Smith stripped KD and book
ATL	It's obvious Trae Young should be an all-star. The Hawks record just stinks and that's a pretty big factor.
	Tom Lee how about curry?
	Nelson Yu Elemino curry could get all star if GSW where winless and he was avg 5 ppg to many bandwagon fans
	Adam Bruhns thas what im saying
	Adam Bruhns Stephen curry this season: 27.5 pts, 5.0 assist, 3.8 rebs.
	Tom Lee what about lakers record
ATL	Not a fan of trae but he should be an all star at this point. Kinda like what happened to Dame. Took a while but maybe next year? 🤷
ATL	Awesome ❣️
	All star
	Chip on his shoulder game for being snubbed out of all-star game
	Natasha Freydin not really snubbed….. dude turns the ball over more then my 7 year old son in the driveway
	Nicholaus Bolle definitely snubbed his offensive production outweigh his turnovers
	Since when does Phoenix have a positive record? They’re literally a last place team without KD
ATL	All star this guy🔥
	All star
ATL	Congratulations
	Snub all star
ATL	All star
PHX	Devin Booker?
	🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
	Rajitha Fernando
ATL	Oh. He's good enough to post about but not good enough for All Star? The NBA should be ashamed of itself. This man IS an All Star. Let the fans pick the starting 5 for East and West. We're the ones buying the tickets, watching the games and purchasing the merch. We picked Trae and Steph to start. This All Star game should be driven by the fans. It is the only game that we can actually choose our players!!
ATL	The Tray
	All stars
	:: Keep on playing. No one cares about the ASG.
ATL	Did the Atlanta Hawks give the Phoenix Suns those birds? Yes, they did.
ATL	And this dude not in the all star game smh 🤦🏾
ATL	Why Is trea not an all-star again?
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović i Trae dokazuje da je morao biti na AS..
	Will b crying Craig Duncan
