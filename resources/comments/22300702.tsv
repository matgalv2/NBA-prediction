	Luka doncic vs the Milwaukee bucks
	Edin Budic Luka doncic the refs vs the bucks
	Lillard had 30 on just 11 shot attempts the bucks made a good coaching move they put Luka in the pick n roll to get him to switch on defense and he went by Luka every time it collapsed the Mavs defense
	40 points.
	Giannis &gt; every international star
	All Texas team will be out of the playIn. You heard it first here!
	All that effort just to get smoked by an Emo Punk coffee drinker in 4-5 games in the playoffs 😩😭☠️🤣
	I thought Dallas would have scored a lot more than that points after that 44 point first quarter
	Chris Lynn everyone was scoring in the first.. then it was up to Luka.. the rest of the guys went average real quick.
	basketball without Giannis is ballet for three pointers... it's that simple for those who enjoy the sport in all it's glory and respect it in all it's guises... unfortunately that, the rest of the sad haters will never understand...
	Νίκος Παπαρρόδου someone who understands the game. Nicely said.
	Νίκος Παπαρρόδου all I hear is whining
	"if ""you saw"" you wouldn't hear her"
	Νίκος Παπαρρόδου Αδερφέ κάθε χρόνο είναι σε MVP τροχιά ο Γιάνναρος. Πλέον δεν έχει να αποδείξει τίποτα και το μόνο που πρέπει να κάνει είναι να παίρνει πρωταθλήματα. Είναι ήδη all time great.
	Mavericks have a ceiling, which is the first round of the playoffs. The very high stats of Doncic have no serious impact, so either the team must make a serious upgrade or he has to go elsewhere
	It doesn’t help the Mavs didn’t have 4 starters this game, and have missed at least 2 or more starters each game since the opener. But even at full strength, the coaching will hold this team back.
	Giannis Antetokounmpo 48 points, 48 games of 40+ points of his career. That's insane.
	The Ant Man💪
	He has to have performances like this just to overcome docs coaching, all just to beat an 8 seed lmao 🤣
	James Reese docs coaching?  The one where Doc literally has this team finally playing some respectable defense.  They ain’t give up 145 points every other night anymore.
	Next up again tonight in Utah against the jazz
	I saw that they won by 12 117-129
	Monstre grecque 🇬🇷🔥
	Yeah!
	🏆💍💪🏿🔥

	By the End of the Season, Luka would have Averaged a 40 point Triple double. He should get a PhD in Basketball with that MVP
	Ikenna F. Nnoli and with 0 ring is nothing all that just an other how take the mvp will be
	Μιχάλης Γκλεζάκος I can't make a sense of what you typed. 
	Ikenna F. Nnoli he almost had a quadruple double with his 9 turnovers tonight
	Looks like Giannis doesn't care about Stats at all. He just wants to win. He is not going for 10 rebounds unless he has to. 
	Ikenna F. Nnoli what a casual..  Luka was short a triple double once again and wasn’t chasing a rebound, -which he easily could’ve gotten in the 4th-because he was pressuring the break the other way to stop Giannis from getting the open court.
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the,2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Fire Kidd!
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
	The Ant Man💪
	Not the type of birthday present I was hoping for tonight.
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Luka joga sozinho nesse time de merda ,de a ele uma equipe a sua altura pra ver do que o tesouro eh capaz
	Ayooo
