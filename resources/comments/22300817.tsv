TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
MIL	I gained a lot of respect for him after watching his documentary. Man’s made it for his family not himself and I love that.
MIL	"So...no one is gonna give doc rivers props, or let me guess ""it's just one game""?"
SPAM	Brandon Strayhorn I'm Paying 7 lucky people that message me with this phrase
MIL	Brandon Strayhorn Yeah, the Doc Hate has me a bit mystified. Several factors for his playoff record (esp Harden). But his overall record over a long period is strong. And in interviews he seems very self reflective. Also, “magically” the defensive rating is going up.
MIL	All fun and games until Milwaukee gets gentleman swept by an Emo Punk coffee drinker in the Playoffs, AGAIN 😩😭☠️🤣
	Johnny Wang lol not the emo punk coffee drinker 🤣😂🤣😂
	T Sho Schoett 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Johnny Wang crazy guys.
	Prediction, second round exit to boston celtics in game 7. East finals knicks vs celtics
	Ian Austria joker
PHI	Unfortunately embiid was out to son him but bucks 76ers with a healthy embiid would be a 🔥 second round matchup
MIL	Richard Renta Giannis and the Bucks have owned Embiid and the Sixers. Try again
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Philadelphia 76ers
MIL	Doc Rivers beating his previous team for the first time since being fired there
PHI	How about that philly? 😂😂😂
	Brandon Wood they didnt have embiid lmao
	Brayhan Adame and lost to the Bucks with Embiid
PHI	Tony O'Bright By 1 point. Philly isn’t threat.
	Omod Galli you’re right, in the East only the Celtics are a threat if the Bucks play to their potential like they have the past 2 games out the break.  Last I checked 1 point or 20 points still equals a loss
	Brandon Wood Bucks were heavily favored 😂
MIL	The next face of NBA after LeBron The King hang his Sneakers. 🏀game!
MIL	Go Bucks Go!💙🏀💚🥰
	Μπράβο σου Γιάννη 👏👏👏👏👏🙋🚴🇬🇷
	Yes...good job GA34
MIL	Great job

	Okay 👍 keep  it up bucks
	🔥🔥🔥🔥
	💚🦌🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
MIL	Giannis should be the MVP favorite
	Everyone that wanted to complain that he was controlling the Bucks is just cherry picking a reason to dislike him at this point. Every GM in the NBA is going to listen to their superstar, especially a team like Milwaukee. Before Giannis what did Milwaukee have? Terrible season after terrible season? The GM would be dumb not to take his opinion into account. He's not the reason the Bucks struggled in the middle of the season, FOH
	Congratulations to Giannis and Bucks team on the victory. Good luck in the next maches
	Proof the Sixers are hot trash. I hope the Celtics win it all
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
	Did he try to throw the ball off his player to try and get that last assist?
MIL	🗑 Azz Team! Of Course they gone win against Philly with no Embid! 😂 💪💨💯🎯

	A'mirsDreamcathcher Miller-Light The beat them in the home opener with Embid.
	A'mirsDreamcathcher Miller-Light yip 76ers are trash.
	The longer Embiid is out, his team the Sixers continue to slide
	Ferdinand Untalan just keep him out the rest of the season and save themselves from embarrassment and let a real team win it all in Beantown
