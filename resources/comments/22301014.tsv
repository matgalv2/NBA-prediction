TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Two absolute calls were not seen by the refs so I must conclude that this game is taken from the hands of the Cavs.
	Can you imagine this team full strength?
	He's still a good veteran player
	 he’s having a really good shooting year also. Timely, important, three pointers
	Minnesota and New Orleans are the only two teams in the West that can give Denver a legitimate run for their money.
	Way to go Timberwolves! 🐺
	The veteran Mike
	Mike Conley
	Mike Conley
	1st round exit for Cleveland 😂
	  say that when we get healthy we are playing without 3 starters right now Strus Mobley &amp; Mitchell
	 Cavs were healthy last year and got bounced round 1, care to make any excuses?? When's the last Cleveland won anything without LeBron? 😂
	Huge win !!!!
	Damn this was a fun game to be at! J-Mac with four 3's and Naz was a beast! 🔥
	Cleveland Cavaliers Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
	🐺 PG's were hoopin'.
	am going to Positively change the lives of 1st five people to write me with the word “GOD BLESSING” let’s end inhumanity 🇺🇸🇨🇦💯
