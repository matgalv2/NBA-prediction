TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Two absolute calls were not seen by the refs so I must conclude that this game is taken from the hands of the Cavs.
	Layla Luna   The refs trying their best to help the cavs but cant make it! Last two weeks  wolves should win but   Refs. They took the wins from wolves !
	🤷🏻
	😁
	Olol Adan Tahar Khayre III didn’t some dude from Cleveland have like 23 free throws.  T Wolves got hosed lol.  And tonight the refs missed all kinds of calls for both teams.
	Craig Nelson Didn’t Anthony Edwards go 0-7 in the 4th qtr and OT in that same game? Including missing the shot that would’ve won the game? Was that the refs fault too?
	Layla Lunajust like the last cavs wolves game was taken from Minnesota by the refs
	Layla Luna 
	He's still a good veteran player
	Rahn Garland he’s having a really good shooting year also. Timely, important, three pointers
	Can you imagine this team full strength?
	Way to go Timberwolves! 🐺
	Jimbo Wally 
	Minnesota and New Orleans are the only two teams in the West that can give Denver a legitimate run for their money.
	The veteran Mike
	Mike Conley
	1st round exit for Cleveland 😂
	Malachi Butts  say that when we get healthy we are playing without 3 starters right now Strus Mobley &amp; Mitchell
	😂
	Malachi Butts Last year? The Cavs aren’t that same team as last year. Last year has nothing to do with this year.
	Mike Conley
	Huge win !!!!
	Damn this was a fun game to be at! J-Mac with four 3's and Naz was a beast! 🔥
	🐺 PG's were hoopin'.
