TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I remember when mikwaukee was the first to 50 and see how far that got them and I'm a bucks fan... playoff birth is a different breed of playing so these regular season wins don't necessarily mean anything besides a locked in seed position. Let's see if the bi hurts or benefits them. Only time will tell!
	If they don't win it all this year....what a total dissapointment of a team
	and the 1st team to exit the playoffs
	😂 nah that’s not going to happen to the Celtics.. we aren’t chokers like the bucks are… hater
	Javier Adrian Medina Nah it's a joke, also I'm a heat fan.
	Kyle and your basing this off of what exactly?
	And will be beaten by 8 during playoff lol.
	Statement win for Boston! Def the best team in the league! I can see them going on another winning streak and will go deep in the playoffs en route to a
	Just a season team 😏
	Every time Boston wins… “it’s just a regular season win. Who cares” 
	😉
	Playoff Jimmy in the way like always lol
	Everyone’s saying first or second round exit like we haven’t been in the ECF or the Finals every year for the past 10 years 
	Boston is team but I'm not impressed until we get to playoff time
	🍀 🍀🍀 THE JAYS WILL FINALLY WIN THE 2024 CHAMPIONSHIP 🤞🏾
	This team gonna win the championship this year! 💚🍀
	😎👌
	🤣🤣
	😂😜
	He went left a lot last night I guess social media getting to him.. it’s just crazy how defense is now.. they drive lower their shoulder to get the defender off balance while driving then shoot.. it’s never called a offensive foul
	Congrats boston celtics get winner in game .. i hope always success for you all team boston celtics ♥
	50 wins and a 1stround exit 😂😂
	All the Wins better = a Ring
	Congratulations Boston!
	And then choke during the playoffs.
	NBA Champs 2023-2024''
	1st round exit
	They could’ve reached 50 a couple games ago
	And Still 2nd round exit...
	And will chock in the playoffs 🥱
	All this just to get knocked out by Miami,
	Only in regular season but in semis  knockdown
	Best record only
	Dah Reel nagbago kna boss dba.... Wag po bitter masama po un...!!!!
	Joel Manalo lol boston only a regular season but playoffs boston is👎 not win a championship real talk.💯%👍
	That's what happens when you drop Danny Ainge as a GM you go from the Bottom to the top ! Danny Ainge is a bottom feeder and in turn your team becomes Bottom Feeders. Jazz need to fire Ainge
	Who cares it’s not post season they have a small roadblock it’s Miami I honestly think they are better but the record does not show it.
	It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.. Cheers to the Celtics..
	Jaylen Brown is better than Jason Tatum!
	2016 gsw record 70w 12 losses but the Cavs epic comeback win in the finals. The ball is circle no one can decide who's gonna win the title this year.😁
	Are the Boston Celtics the first NBA team to 50 wins in the 2023-2024 season? Yes, they are.
	Imagine if shai have , brown, white , porzingis and holiday . And tatum for exchange to the okc do you think okc will take the 1st seed
	The Boston Celtics: the only team in the NBA that refs allowed to flop
	#arnold magno lang sakalam 6 tama 1k
	Oh wow totally expected the blazers to win 🤣 keep up the Celtics glaze
	Bruh I just need 1 fucking point and Celtics missed the free-throw.
	They’ll get to 60 too
	😩❤️
	☘️
	They have one of the best records every season , they just can’t win a championship
	Go Blazers! Better luck next time
	The Mighty Boston Celtics been serving up that green HATERAID all season 
	Just to lose in playoffs lmao 😂
	They’re gonna choke again like they did last year
