TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	I remember when mikwaukee was the first to 50 and see how far that got them and I'm a bucks fan... playoff birth is a different breed of playing so these regular season wins don't necessarily mean anything besides a locked in seed position. Let's see if the bi hurts or benefits them. Only time will tell!
	 the bi will benefit the Celtics since porzingis always seems to get injured if he’s playing a lot of games
	 If you think this record means nothing for this group you haven’t been watching
	If they don't win it all this year....what a total dissapointment of a team
	 I’m a big Celtics fan and I have to agree. Celtics fans have waited so long for this group to put it all together, and hopefully the wait is over. ☘️
	 pray that they do win it
	 no.1 against no.8..
	 I wouldn't necessarily say that because Denver still has everyone's number. Boston is great but they aren't perfect and haven't gotten full team integration down tona science like Denver. And we shoot too many 3s to be honest.
	 ‼️ Hi Baby ‼️
	and the 1st team to exit the playoffs
	 and your basing this off of what exactly?
	 Room temperature IQ comment of the day 🤝
	 you must be a bucks fan 😂 nah that’s not going to happen to the Celtics.. we aren’t chokers like the bucks are… hater
	 Nah it's a joke, also I'm a heat fan.
	And will be beaten by 8 during playoff lol.
	You do know we knocked the heat out the year before that right? Doubtful you seem dim
	 he’s probably a salty Filipino Lakers fan, not our fault your team is so rubbish
	Statement win for Boston! Def the best team in the league! I can see them going on another winning streak and will go deep in the playoffs en route to a
	 copy and paste bot
	 try to win a game, losing against the wizards, what an embarrasment😆
	 little wang
	Just a season team 😏
	 just a season team? You must be a piston fan 😂😂
	 not going to matter if they don't win it all
	Every time Boston wins… “it’s just a regular season win. Who cares” 
	 I'm a Celtic fan and im inclined to believe them because for us, that's the main thing. We made it before and we didn't translate well from season to playoffs.
	 Denver in 6 😉
	Once again Tatum shows up 
	 against Blazers?👀😂
	Everyone’s saying first or second round exit like we haven’t been in the ECF or the Finals every year for the past 10 years 
	 And then what happen next?
	 never a first round exit
	" ""Oh they're not a first or second round exit? Let me just move the goal posts."" Clown shit"
	 y'all made it there every year for the last 10 years but they haven't held one of these during the last 10 years. 😂😂
	Playoff Jimmy in the way like always lol
	🍀 🍀🍀 THE JAYS WILL FINALLY WIN THE 2024 CHAMPIONSHIP 🤞🏾
	Boston is team but I'm not impressed until we get to playoff time
	This team gonna win the championship this year! 💚🍀
	 dont sleep lakers going to boom this year mark my word brother😎👌
	 we will see in 18 more games! I hope your king will enter the playoffs! 🤣🤣
	 wag lng jokic ulit 😂😜
	Still not their season jks lol
	Boston Celtics Vs Portland Trail Blazers
	He went left a lot last night I guess social media getting to him.. it’s just crazy how defense is now.. they drive lower their shoulder to get the defender off balance while driving then shoot.. it’s never called a offensive foul
	JB the best Celtics player
	And then choke during the playoffs.
	"Ma believe Sana ako SA team Ng Boston kaso SA play offs palaging laglag .. . Indi nila mamainten ung laruan NIla SA play offs saka pag play offs Jan talaga nagllabasan Ng laru .. Kaya dapat  mag ready sila SA play offs mode Ng malalakas na team .. sorr… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	50 wins and a 1stround exit 😂😂
	 kelan nag 1st round exit celtics sa era ni brown at Tatum dungis?
	 2021
	 edi 2nd round exit happy kana baboy?
	 Brooklyn Nets kalaban nila,,trio nila erving, Durant, harden,,1st round exit yun
	Knicks vs Celtics in the conferference
	 they have never 1st round exited in the Tatum era 5 straight ecf and they're better now with porzingis and jrue. .
	 okey ecf exit happy? hahahaha
	 yes much better
	 kamote
	 kupal hahaha
	 pala comment yung kambal ni taguro puta hahahaha
	 pangit
	All the Wins better = a Ring
	Congrats boston celtics get winner in game .. i hope always success for you all team boston celtics ♥
	NBA Champs 2023-2024''
	Congratulations Boston!
	Mukhang now na Boston Celtics champion of the NBA
	1st round exit
	 they never exit in first round.Maybe you're team does
	 that ain't happening for sure
	It's 50 🔥🔥🎉
	How many career points can Durant surpass?
	They could’ve reached 50 a couple games ago
	And Still 2nd round exit...
	 it's always third round exit .. in the past 5 years it been 5 straight ecf and one finals appearance
	 mismo
	Joel Manalo lol boston only a regular season but playoffs boston is👎 not win a championship real talk.💯%👍
	Only in regular season but in semis  knockdown
	Panay pinoy ang galit sa Boston ko ah ha ha always in the playoffs kasi naiinis na sila lagi kasi nasa finals ng east
	And will chock in the playoffs 🥱
	Best record only
	And also first team to go in bora🤣🤣
	Wala to sa playoffs.
	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
	Jaylen Jeffrey Jordan, this man has no left
	That's what happens when you drop Danny Ainge as a GM you go from the Bottom to the top ! Danny Ainge is a bottom feeder and in turn your team becomes Bottom Feeders. Jazz need to fire Ainge
	 He's led this team and really hasn't accomplished much, and that's the biggest disservice of all!
	Who cares it’s not post season they have a small roadblock it’s Miami I honestly think they are better but the record does not show it.
	It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.. Cheers to the Celtics..
	Jaylen Brown is better than Jason Tatum!
	2016 gsw record 70w 12 losses but the Cavs epic comeback win in the finals. The ball is circle no one can decide who's gonna win the title this year.😁
	The Boston Celtics: the only team in the NBA that refs allowed to flop
	Imagine if shai have , brown, white , porzingis and holiday . And tatum for exchange to the okc do you think okc will take the 1st seed
	Shai&gt;tatum 100 facts
	 magno lang sakalam 6 tama 1k
	All to lose at playoff
	Bruh I just need 1 fucking point and Celtics missed the free-throw.
	Oh wow totally expected the blazers to win 🤣 keep up the Celtics glaze
	Celtics dominate
	 it’s our year 💪🏼
	Are the Boston Celtics the first NBA team to 50 wins in the 2023-2024 season? Yes, they are.
	Ang team nga kusog lng ug season,pag abot sa playoffs nganga😅🤣
	 tsy lany oa reto 😅
	 blazers fakana victoire e😂
	 fa Zahay ko sady mahay 😚😂
	All this just to get knocked out by Miami,
	 pffff Miami ain't got shitttt this season on Boston. Good luck with that
	Second round exit
	all of this just to bounce in the 2nd round lol
	They’ll get to 60 too
	mayabang na wla PNG napatunayan
	😩❤️
	☘️
	They have one of the best records every season , they just can’t win a championship
	Boston Celtics el primer equipo eta temporada en llegar un equipo que está haciendo cosa impresionante esta temporada un juego Al Horford jugo 11 puntos y 4 Rebote y 4 asistencia para el pívot dominicano de un 3-3 de triple 100% y jugo su posición la del pívot pero como titular Porzigis está lesionao o descansado Boston sin jrue holiday tenía a Derek white como escolta que es su segunda posición y a Payton Pritchard como point guard que es el segundo point guard que puede jugar como escolta y Pritchard estaba jugando como point guard su posición original y por jrue holiday Y Derek white con su posición original también la del shooting guard el combo guard titular de los Boston Celtics es jrue holiday como base y Derek white como escolta y lo rotan y da lo mismo en la posición 1,2 sólamente jrue holiday estaba descansado o lesionao
	Go Blazers! Better luck next time
	pure meat 💪
