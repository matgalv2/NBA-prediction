TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I remember when mikwaukee was the first to 50 and see how far that got them and I'm a bucks fan... playoff birth is a different breed of playing so these regular season wins don't necessarily mean anything besides a locked in seed position. Let's see if the bi hurts or benefits them. Only time will tell!
	If they don't win it all this year....what a total dissapointment of a team
	and the 1st team to exit the playoffs
BOS	😂 nah that’s not going to happen to the Celtics.. we aren’t chokers like the bucks are… hater
	Javier Adrian Medina Nah it's a joke, also I'm a heat fan.
	Kyle and your basing this off of what exactly?
	And will be beaten by 8 during playoff lol.
BOS	Statement win for Boston! Def the best team in the league! I can see them going on another winning streak and will go deep in the playoffs en route to a
BOS	Just a season team 😏
BOS	Every time Boston wins… “it’s just a regular season win. Who cares”
	😉
	Playoff Jimmy in the way like always lol
BOS	Everyone’s saying first or second round exit like we haven’t been in the ECF or the Finals every year for the past 10 years

	That's what happens when you drop Danny Ainge as a GM you go from the Bottom to the top ! Danny Ainge is a bottom feeder and in turn your team becomes Bottom Feeders. Jazz need to fire Ainge
	Who cares it’s not post season they have a small roadblock it’s Miami I honestly think they are better but the record does not show it.
BOS	It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.. Cheers to the Celtics..
BOS	Jaylen Brown is better than Jason Tatum!
	2016 gsw record 70w 12 losses but the Cavs epic comeback win in the finals. The ball is circle no one can decide who's gonna win the title this year.😁
BOS	Are the Boston Celtics the first NBA team to 50 wins in the 2023-2024 season? Yes, they are.
BOS	Imagine if shai have , brown, white , porzingis and holiday . And tatum for exchange to the okc do you think okc will take the 1st seed
BOS	The Boston Celtics: the only team in the NBA that refs allowed to flop
	#arnold magno lang sakalam 6 tama 1k
