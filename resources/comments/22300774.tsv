TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Game was in Phoenix NBA. Fire the admin and hire someone better 😂.
	Eli Valencia lmao
SAC	Kings had the two best players on the court and couldn't finish the job. 🙄
SPAM	Scott Savage https://www.facebook.com/groups/2024nbaallstargame
PHX	Scott Savage In a way. KD is a veteran future HOFer. Him and Booker are both in the top 10 discussion for MVP and are both top 10 players for the season.

SAC	Kings wasnt always called FAIRLY at any given game… this suns is second rounder on
	Dave Dave stop crying and take the L
	Dave Dave announcers commented on some calls.
	Dave Dave I’m a kings fan and I agree BUT regardless of the officiating, we still had multiple opportunities to win the game. We didn’t get stops when it mattered and couldn’t make free throws when it counted.
	Sacramento Kings Vs Phoenix Suns
	Was the game not played in Phoenix ?
	Alexandar Sotirov it was
	Adrian Garcia the title says in Sacramento but never mind 🙂
	Alexandar Sotirov that’s the NBA for ya 😂
PHX	Devin Booker
	Can't beat the officials and the team
SAC	Chris Connelly 123-124 after Sabonis sinks a bucket with Booker literally on his back…..no call. A call there could’ve made a big difference . Also, Fox shoots the league worst FT% for guards. They have to do better
	Rich Bedell cry abt it
	Chiquilin Araujo
	Game was in Phoenix....get your facts straight
PHX	Great win Boyz. Number 5 seed and moving up☄️☄️☄️
	Jerrold McMurry Other than Mavs, the schedule is super easy for the next like 6 games. Rockets 3 times. Pistons. Lakers. Should rack up a few wins in that stretch.
PHX	Right now in Europe as a European the media Felles more the truth that booker and Durant are amazing they plays from other planet … not like the media in Nertila who try to make a player like Sabonis interesting …I am dissapountet because De Aaron fox was snubbed from the all star game
PHX	We won a thriller in PHX at footprint center !
	Covered by .5! I had kings! Always buy 1 extra point!
PHX	What a great game 😍
PHX	Congrats Suns&amp;KD
	It was in Phoenix lol
