	Love Joker for sure but I believe this man is still the game’s best player!!!!
	 Nah, Nikola Jokic is still the best, especially since he's not a free throw merchant like Giannis Attemptafreethrow.
	 ok keyboard warrior.
	 Take a look in the mirror, dingus.
	 I'm not the one bagging professional athletes. Where you are the button basher lad.
	 Yeah, because I'm sure you've never criticized a professional athlete once in your life, button basher.  You're either a liar or a hypocrite.  Take your pick.
	 no way!!
	 drawing foul shots is the most efficient way to score while also wearing down the opposing team’s depth 🤷‍♂️
	  say it all the time a healthy Giannis is the best player in the world and he has a DPOY to prove it !!
	 absolutely not … jokic is basketball magician for this guy
	Fearless predic, bucks vs knicks east finals. Yes you have hear me right celtics will fall to knicks in the second round, philly will be out in the first round, and miami will bow to milwaukee in the second row. Great path
	 the knicks who lost to the Celtics all 4 times this year lol ?
	Ryan Verrilli last year didn’t the Celtics beat the Heat all 4 times in regular season, but got beat in playoffs? I could be wrong though, usually looking up much older stats lol.
	 they beat the Celtics with Marcus Smart at PG. Easily done. No one but the Celtics will be going through to the finals this year. That’s a given. It’s whether they can beat Denver in 7
	 I mean, Marcus Smart has nearly identical numbers to Jrue Holiday , though Holiday is a bit better from 3pt land. Both are proven defensively minded players. That doesn’t seem like enough to change the possible outcome. We will see though if Celtics finally learn from previous playoff experience, but recent history points to that they won’t.
	 it’s not the numbers, it’s the decision making at crucial times. I have yet to see Jrue start jacking up contested 3s or giving away the ball at crucial moments. Smart almost single handedly lost that ECF game 7 against Miami 2 season back, when up by 11 with 2 mins to go and somehow turning the ball over 3 times by himself in a minute
	 like I said, we will see. History isn’t on their side though lol.
	 you’re the most delusional person I have ever met. Nobody is beating the Celtics in a 7 game series. Only teams that have a chance are on the west coast and I’m still not worried.
	" Ian Giannis is truly their Superman and Lillard is a great shooter most of the time but they don’t have enough on both sides of the ball this year. Celtics staring 5 along either their bench guys all can shoot and play defense. Knicks will … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Still not convinced by their defense.
	Barely beat an embiidless 76ers 😂
	MVP MVP MVP  Giannis ❤️❤️❤️❤️
	How many 3-pointers can Curry make in his career?
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	Me parece que el anillo se queda esta temporada en la conferencia del Este.
	Looking forward to the next competition.
	32 points, 11 rebounds &amp; 13 travels
	 salty
	 dude constantly takes 3 to 4 steps
	A healthy Giannis is the best player in the world !!
	Without Embiid , Sixers is just a team of plumbers,,smh.
	  yeah maxeys billboard hes a good player. But billboard lol
	I’m not going to lie I know lillard going through some shit right now. I’m not married so I can’t relate but he needs to do better overall as the second best player on the team.. the bucks should be nasty right now but their defense is crazy.. good game but overall they need to do better or they NOT going to stop Boston
	 part of it is they are missing khris...dame and giannis will improve with middleton on the court
	Refs helped him get the W by all the foul calls that he got up Maxey didn't and ridiculous allowance of traveling
	Can't touch this
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
	Il ne fait rien ces deux jours la ..GSA est dans le Ring

	🥱 You forgot to mention that Giannis Attemptafreethrow needed 18 free throw attempts to get those 32 points, against a 76ers team without Joel Embiid.  And some people actually think Attemptafreethrow should be MVP.  😂
	 you're pathetic.
	 Take a look the mirror, dingus.
	 clean your tears.
	 others miss those free trows in crucial moments.
	🥰
