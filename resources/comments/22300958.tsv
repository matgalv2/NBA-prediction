TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Love Joker for sure but I believe this man is still the game’s best player!!!!
	Bryan Tali Nah, Nikola Jokic is still the best, especially since he's not a free throw merchant like Giannis Attemptafreethrow.
	Jason Samuels ok keyboard warrior.
	John Jenkins Take a look in the mirror, dingus.
	Jason Samuels I'm not the one bagging professional athletes. Where you are the button basher lad.
	John Jenkins Yeah, because I'm sure you've never criticized a professional athlete once in your life, button basher.  You're either a liar or a hypocrite.  Take your pick.
	Jason Samuels no way!!
	🤷‍♂️
	Bryan Tali  say it all the time a healthy Giannis is the best player in the world and he has a DPOY to prove it !!
	Bryan Tali absolutely not … jokic is basketball magician for this guy
	Fearless predic, bucks vs knicks east finals. Yes you have hear me right celtics will fall to knicks in the second round, philly will be out in the first round, and miami will bow to milwaukee in the second row. Great path
	Ian Austria the knicks who lost to the Celtics all 4 times this year lol ?
	Ryan Verrilli last year didn’t the Celtics beat the Heat all 4 times in regular season, but got beat in playoffs? I could be wrong though, usually looking up much older stats lol.
	Nathan Bartel they beat the Celtics with Marcus Smart at PG. Easily done. No one but the Celtics will be going through to the finals this year. That’s a given. It’s whether they can beat Denver in 7
	Paul Haggarty I mean, Marcus Smart has nearly identical numbers to Jrue Holiday , though Holiday is a bit better from 3pt land. Both are proven defensively minded players. That doesn’t seem like enough to change the possible outcome. We will see though if Celtics finally learn from previous playoff experience, but recent history points to that they won’t.
	Nathan Bartel it’s not the numbers, it’s the decision making at crucial times. I have yet to see Jrue start jacking up contested 3s or giving away the ball at crucial moments. Smart almost single handedly lost that ECF game 7 against Miami 2 season bac… Wyświetl więcej
	Paul Haggarty like I said, we will see. History isn’t on their side though lol.
	Ian Austria you’re the most delusional person I have ever met. Nobody is beating the Celtics in a 7 game series. Only teams that have a chance are on the west coast and I’m still not worried.
	🏀
	Still not convinced by their defense.
	Barely beat an embiidless 76ers 😂
	MVP MVP MVP  Giannis ❤️❤️❤️❤️
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	How many 3-pointers can Curry make in his career?
	Me parece que el anillo se queda esta temporada en la conferencia del Este.
	32 points, 11 rebounds &amp; 13 travels
	Jay Sal salty
	John Jenkins dude constantly takes 3 to 4 steps
	A healthy Giannis is the best player in the world !!
	Without Embiid , Sixers is just a team of plumbers,,smh.
	Calvin Jackson  yeah maxeys billboard hes a good player. But billboard lol
	I’m not going to lie I know lillard going through some shit right now. I’m not married so I can’t relate but he needs to do better overall as the second best player on the team.. the bucks should be nasty right now but their defense is crazy.. good game but overall they need to do better or they NOT going to stop Boston
	Dre Steph part of it is they are missing khris...dame and giannis will improve with middleton on the court
	Refs helped him get the W by all the foul calls that he got up Maxey didn't and ridiculous allowance of traveling
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
	Il ne fait rien ces deux jours la ..GSA est dans le Ring
	Can't touch this
	thank ur brother dude, hes always there to guard and protect u from ur antics!😂😂😂

	Sports Gossip Village i should have been more clear. Nice expression! What a phony dirtbag pro wrestler wannabe basketball player. Thats my ball! Wah wah, cry more. Can my brother be on the team too? Worst player ever.

	Milwaukee we want you we want you. Lets Go Knicks
	Without embiid.😆😆
	Gianniiiiis
	hack a Koumpo
	Chris Shields
	🥱 You forgot to mention that Giannis Attemptafreethrow needed 18 free throw attempts to get those 32 points, against a 76ers team without Joel Embiid.  And some people actually think Attemptafreethrow should be MVP.  😂
	Jason Samuels you're pathetic.
	Zach J Pietraszewski Take a look the mirror, dingus.
	Jason Samuels clean your tears.
	Jason Samuels others miss those free trows in crucial moments.
