TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Best. Laker   team i love It❤️❤️❤️
	See how PG13 is so valuable to Harden being the System and Kawhi to be able to dominate? You get back PG13, you get back the team to win. Easy as that.
	Harden was hot, 4 consecutive treys is 🤯🤯🤯. If only he plays like these always, Clippers will be in a better place for sure.
	Mhaze, he plays like this in April - June, and the clips will be in a better place for sure.
	The system is working
	They can beat bad teams and struggle against good teams and with Westbrook out, the Clippers are in trouble.
	Im still not over the fact that they blew 21+ points against lakers.
	Nompilo Mpeeloh Nkosi ask the coaches . A very winnable game but choked . Seen it in 2 games against the Lakers , very suspicious …
	Nompilo Mpeeloh Nkosi big time choke
	there was more defense in the all star game 😆
	At this point, don't be that team😂
	Look who they beat 😂
	To bad he doesn’t play like that in big games
	Let's go #ClippersTeam we're hungry again for the consecutive winning process😎✌ 
	Well done James!!
