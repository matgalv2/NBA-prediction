TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	Best. Laker   team i love It❤️❤️❤️
LAC	See how PG13 is so valuable to Harden being the System and Kawhi to be able to dominate? You get back PG13, you get back the team to win. Easy as that.
LAC	Harden was hot, 4 consecutive treys is 🤯🤯🤯. If only he plays like these always, Clippers will be in a better place for sure.
LAC	Mhaze, he plays like this in April - June, and the clips will be in a better place for sure.
LAC	The system is working
LAC	They can beat bad teams and struggle against good teams and with Westbrook out, the Clippers are in trouble.
LAC	Im still not over the fact that they blew 21+ points against lakers.
LAC	Nompilo Mpeeloh Nkosi ask the coaches . A very winnable game but choked . Seen it in 2 games against the Lakers , very suspicious …
