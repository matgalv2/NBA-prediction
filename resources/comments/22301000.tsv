	There's something fishy about SGA with his 31 points.
	 It’s all rigged.  31 is 13 backwards and that’s Taylor Swift’s favorite #… so I’m sure she has something to do with it! 🤔🤔
	Reignited ROTY debate, especially if he continues playing like that for the remainder of the season.
	 🤷🏽‍♂️ 😉
	 he finally shows up again 🤣
	Great statline from Chet but I would put him 3rd in the Rookie of the Year race next to Wemby and the soon to be 7-time rookie of the year Ben 10 Simmons 😤😤😤😤
	Chet was a walking highlight reel
	Okc has the best talent scouts in the history of the league. They would have gift wrapped kd an all star cast until he retired. He had no real reason to leave.
	 Seriously, might end up being the best organization talent wise to never get a championship
	he’ll end his career averaging 31 pts per game
	This young man is real force. A quiet force. A full option player like wembanyama and more
	Just bet that SGA gets 31 points and you’ll get rich 👌🏻
	Wemby gets that line and we yawn.
	That is what is called rookies or year
	My boy with another 31 points
	They will be the team that gets in the playoffs and gets bounced quick then next year go deep. Judging by the history of the game .
	u have yall notice that sga scores 31 on purpose
	Dude not getting any muscle yet he's getting skinnier playoffs will be difficult for okc
	ROTY runner-up!
	Sophomore of the Year
	Utah Jazz Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
	Sophomore of the year!
	Well done Chet!!
	The 2nd year ROOKIE😂
	 Took the lead for ROY
	 he’s still several miles behind wemby but definitely tied  miller for runner up
	 nigga wtf
	✨✨👋🏼
	
	We root for OKC
	Wemby would do even more if he was on a team with the players Chet has
	Better than wemby💪💪
	ROY
	SGA strikes again.
	This a typical game from wemby. 
	If OKC can keep this team together and healthy going forward, they’re going to be a problem for years to come
	The best!!
	Hes not a rookie
	 he is.
	 last time I checked a rookie was his first year he was drafted 2 years there for he's not a rookie and the nba is lame for doing that.
	 please do share the source you used “last time you checked” that leads you to believe that a player is considered to have played his rookie season without actually playing. Your opinion is irrelevant.
	 you were done before you started, noob.
	Wemby still better than
	He had himself a Wembanyama kinda night !!!
	He ain't ready,They ain't gonna win nothing, I'm betting anything y'all wanna bet
	Shai with another 31
	Congrats chet
	Wow! Chet did it!
	ROTY
	THIS IS MY WAY  OF HELPING OUT THOSE FACING CHALLENGES THIS YEAR, l'll be SUPPORT SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH 6 GRAND WHO WRITES TO ME USING THE PHRASE «GOD DID»
	Chet frfr. 
	Things are kinda tough out here especially this time of the year so I’m gifting 5 grand to the first 5 people to message me with “HARD TIME” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.💙
