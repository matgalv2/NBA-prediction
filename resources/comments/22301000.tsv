OKC	There's something fishy about SGA with his 31 points.
OKC	🤔🤔
OKC	Reignited ROTY debate, especially if he continues playing like that for the remainder of the season.
UTA	🤷🏽‍♂️ 😉
UTA	🤣
OKC	Great statline from Chet but I would put him 3rd in the Rookie of the Year race next to Wemby and the soon to be 7-time rookie of the year Ben 10 Simmons 😤😤😤😤
OKC	Chet was a walking highlight reel
OKC	Okc has the best talent scouts in the history of the league. They would have gift wrapped kd an all star cast until he retired. He had no real reason to leave.
OKC	Byron Robusky Jr. Seriously, might end up being the best organization talent wise to never get a championship
OKC	he’ll end his career averaging 31 pts per game
OKC	This young man is real force. A quiet force. A full option player like wembanyama and more
OKC	Just bet that SGA gets 31 points and you’ll get rich 👌🏻
	Wemby gets that line and we yawn.
OKC	That is what is called rookies or year
OKC	They will be the team that gets in the playoffs and gets bounced quick then next year go deep. Judging by the history of the game .
OKC	My boy with another 31 points
OKC	Dude not getting any muscle yet he's getting skinnier playoffs will be difficult for okc
	Sophomore of the Year
OKC	ROTY runner-up!
	Utah Jazz Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
	u have yall notice that sga scores 31 on purpose
	Sophomore of the year!
OKC	Well done Chet!!
OKC	The 2nd year ROOKIE😂
	Jay Tee Took the lead for ROY
OKC	✨✨👋🏼
	Ramin Oskoui
OKC	👏 he won’t beat Wemby for ROY
OKC	We root for OKC
OKC	Wemby would do even more if he was on a team with the players Chet has
OKC	Better than wemby💪💪
OKC	ROY
OKC	SGA strikes again.
	This a typical game from wemby.
OKC	If OKC can keep this team together and healthy going forward, they’re going to be a problem for years to come
OKC	The best!!
OKC	Hes not a rookie
	Gage Zupancic he is.
OKC	He had himself a Wembanyama kinda night !!!
	Wemby still better than
	He ain't ready,They ain't gonna win nothing, I'm betting anything y'all wanna bet
OKC	Shai with another 31
OKC	Congrats chet
OKC	Wow! Chet did it!
OKC	ROTY
	THIS IS MY WAY  OF HELPING OUT THOSE FACING CHALLENGES THIS YEAR, l'll be SUPPORT SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH 6 GRAND WHO WRITES TO ME USING THE PHRASE «GOD DID»
	Chet frfr. 
	Things are kinda tough out here especially this time of the year so I’m gifting 5 grand to the first 5 people to message me with “HARD TIME” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.💙
