	How do we beat these good teams and lose to Brooklyn, Washington and Detroit🥹😳👀
	We have to keep Caruso at all costs he's our best all around player

	Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, and Caruso are making Lavine dispensable by the day...
	Timberwolves is not doing good recently starting from their loss to OKC right there at their backyard at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
	Lakers should have resigned him instead of Vincent 😒
	Trong Ng AR is an upgrade

	The T-wolves put up a great performance, but the Bulls prevailed this time. Congrats to the Bulls on their win.
	Stefan Zivkovic Wolves weren’t great. Couldn’t hit a shot and didn’t defend the three.
	Ted Nichols Everybody has the right to have a bad day/night. Even on those occasions, not losing by a large margin, is a great feat itself.
	They built Caruso based on Elmer Fudd in space jam
