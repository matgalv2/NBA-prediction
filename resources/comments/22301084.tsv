	How do we beat these good teams and lose to Brooklyn, Washington and Detroit🥹😳👀
	 because y'all ain't ready yet.
	 Basketball is all about match up.
	We have to keep Caruso at all costs he's our best all around player
	 what dude is not an all around player he rarely scores in double figures he is not a 2 way player and is a developing offensive player this the first time in his career with an average above 9 ppg and at 10
	Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, and Caruso are making Lavine dispensable by the day...
	 he’s always been that player. Dont let the flashy player disguise how bad his basketball iq is
	all his 21points came from threes
	So we beat the top teams only to lose to the bottom teams but hey , Is not rigged right ?? Lol
	 why do you think KG left?  Because Minny will never win it all.
	 gotta pay closer attention man it’s not that simple.
	Timberwolves is not doing good recently starting from their loss to OKC right there at their backyard at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
	 what are you on? They run over Denver other day.....
	el show de toda la nba, tiros de larga distancia, este jugador, sus 21 pts resultado de 7 triples, que porcentaje tendria en tiros de campo?
	Lakers should have resigned him instead of Vincent 😒
	 AR is an upgrade
	 for bench unit, Lakers bench is weak
	Great player and better team mate !
	 so you overrate players you like
	The T-wolves put up a great performance, but the Bulls prevailed this time. Congrats to the Bulls on their win.
	 Wolves weren’t great. Couldn’t hit a shot and didn’t defend the three.
	 Everybody has the right to have a bad day/night. Even on those occasions, not losing by a large margin, is a great feat itself.
	They built Caruso based on Elmer Fudd in space jam
	Reeves.
	Come back to the Lakers Carushow🙌🏽
	 u wish , bulls keeping him
	Where's Ant Man? The mayabang 😭🤣🤣👏
	Alex Caruso shows he's got it
	Ant Man is Crying Man today
	 plz clippers get him somehow 😭😭
	3nD on display

	 Hello 👋 Kris
	
	
	
	  😁
	Another Good Victory For The Bulls
	Nice..Acaruso❤️🔥💪
	The Bulls got it done on Easter Sunday
	Love this dude!!
	I'm really suprised that Chicago actually played up to competition, but I thank them, as it helps the Nuggets!
	Always a good day when the Suns, Lakers , Wolves, thunder and Grizzlies lose.
	Caruso really went off tonight, crazy 7-8 from 3PT
	Que the nerd non hoopers favorite player 21 pts 5 and 5 isn't dominant, click bate for geeks 🤣
	The best to ever do it 🤷🏾‍♂️
	That man made 7 out of 8 3s 🤯🤯🤯
	Turn up the AC!
	 Wolvesi dobiju Clipperse dva puta, Clippersi dobiju Bullse rutinski i sada ti isti Bullsi dobiju Wolvese..
	God bless you Sir.
	Chicago Bulls Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
	Contender because of GOAT Caruso
	
	"I'm Gifting 5 grands for the season to the first five people to hit me up ""GRACE"" because I know some people are going through hard times.Y'all stay blessed"
	"I was also struggling at a time and knows how hard it is to pay bills. I'll be gifting 5 grands to the first Ten people to hit me up ""GOD IS GOOD"" y'all remain blessed."
	Lakers were dumb to ever let the goat go

	People who give up easily are the people who lose in life. My first experience happened to be a failure but I never gave up because I knew it was going to work out for me so I kept trying. I'm smiling today for getting involved with Mrs

	"That guy, and DeRozan, each could have turned the tide for a contender. What a waste. Chicago is stuck in the purgatory of some bad contracts and being too good for a top lottery pick, but not good enough to contend. And no easy way to get there, bc no… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Caruso being wasted. Lavine and derozan fell off BAD, but the Bulls have a lot of good players they're just keeping in purgatory
	Alex Caruso will go down as the 14th highest scoring Bull of all time 🤣
	 good job buddy
	This stinks to get beat by a subpar team down the stretch 👎🏿
	Wow
	Just like 2k you can always lose to the worst! 🤣
	White Mamba.
	sira parlay HAHAHAHA
	Lakers should have not traded Caruso.
	 Luck the Fakeshow.
	Aguas con lo bul tiembla celtics 😂😂😂😂🫵🏻
