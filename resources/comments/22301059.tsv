	5 blocks is no joke. Nice stat line.
	 Yo fam
	And 8 TO from him. To Many KD 👏👏
	 Yo fam
	Suns/nuggets rivalry is fun, I like it.
	Its a good day whenever KD and the suns beat jokic and denver😜
	 why you hate greatness?
	 what do you mean i hate greatness, i love kd🤣
	 I mean jokic and my nuggets goofy KD has no legs kick him and they shatter😂
	 I am humble 🧐
	No crying, no sulking, no kicking of chairs, no ripping of jersery, no crazy antics, no showboating! Durant is the greatest Warrior ever!
	 Yo fam
	Nuggets in 5
	Yeah stats great but he's still not gonna win another championship.
	Hitting their stride at the perfect time.
	"Great game by the suns.  As a nuggets fan,  it's hard to watch games like these without having Murray in the lineup.   Having said that, suns scoring only 104 with Murray out of the lineup should be concerning.   Suns will be a scary team come playoffs… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Everyone who is counting the suns out are just not real . Sure , they can choke completely, but if they they connect and find they rhythm … 
	 they lost to the spurs but beat the nuggets. Talk about shotty execution. They're a wildcard at best
	 there you go . People without any clue about bb .. so ? They can choke sure same as they can beat anyone .
	 Yo fam
	It’s too bad Denver will repeat
	Suns is the biggest threat for Nuggets, they want them to win so they can climb up to 6.. if they make it to conference they will face each other, big IF for suns.. or they can meet at 8 vs 1..
	KD the best of all time
	Jokic gift to KD a Big Win😅
	WAY TO GO‼️‼️🏀❣️👵🏻
	 Yo fam
	Here comes the original OKC Thunder😎👌
	 Yo fam

	 Yo fam
	Let’s go KD!!!
	<a class=💯
	Thank you Suns (Minny needed that win against Nugs)
	If KD play hard ..100%win rate
	How the hell do you lose to the wemby-less spurs then beat denver at home?
	What happened to that silly 3PM stat line?
	I’m so glad the Nuggets lost!
	Not a good team.... Individuals players who won't win in the playoffs
	Best teams in the west are selling so Lakers wont enter the playoffs lol
	Still gone choke in the playoffs 😂
	Nuggets purposely lost this game so lakers odds of getting the 8th minimize.
	Nuggets purposely lose to prevent the Lakers from going up the standings 👎
	Wierd game. Alot of foul calls
	CongratsKD idol
	What a beautiful day Golden nuggets lose🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	What a warriors need right now
	SHOWS that there's breach in the Joker's armour.

	Imagine if KD said “ I feel like dropping 50 tonight”  EVERY NIGHT CAUSE WHO’s STOPPING HIM ? Lol

	People forget that the Suns is the only team last playoffs to beat the Nuggets twice while Suns leader is injured. Suns is the only threat to Nuggets this coming playoffs. Wolves Kings and Thunders are all joke
