	Suns/nuggets rivalry is fun, I like it.
	Great game by the suns.  As a nuggets fan,  it's hard to watch games like these without having Murray in the lineup.   Having said that, suns scoring only 104 with Murray out of the lineup should be concerning.   Suns will be a scary team come playoffs.  However playoff basketball is much different than regular season.   I hope these teams meet in the WCF.  Should be a fun series to watch.   🍿
	No crying, no sulking, no kicking of chairs, no ripping of jersery, no crazy antics, no showboating! Durant is the greatest Warrior ever!

	Its a good day whenever KD and the suns beat jokic and denver😜
	AL Lan why you hate greatness?
	Nuggets in 5
	Yeah stats great but he's still not gonna win another championship.
	It’s too bad Denver will repeat
	Everyone who is counting the suns out are just not real . Sure , they can choke completely, but if they they connect and find they rhythm … 
	KD the best of all time
	Suns is the biggest threat for Nuggets, they want them to win so they can climb up to 6.. if they make it to conference they will face each other, big IF for suns.. or they can meet at 8 vs 1..
	Jokic gift to KD a Big Win😅

	Thank you Suns (Minny needed that win against Nugs)
	How the hell do you lose to the wemby-less spurs then beat denver at home?
	If KD play hard ..100%win rate
	I’m so glad the Nuggets lost!
	What happened to that silly 3PM stat line?
	Not a good team.... Individuals players who won't win in the playoffs
	Best teams in the west are selling so Lakers wont enter the playoffs lol
	Nuggets purposely lose to prevent the Lakers from going up the standings 👎
	Still gone choke in the playoffs 😂
	Nuggets purposely lost this game so lakers odds of getting the 8th minimize.
	Wierd game. Alot of foul calls
