DEN	Suns/nuggets rivalry is fun, I like it.
DEN	Great game by the suns.  As a nuggets fan,  it's hard to watch games like these without having Murray in the lineup.   Having said that, suns scoring only 104 with Murray out of the lineup should be concerning.   Suns will be a scary team come playoffs.  However playoff basketball is much different than regular season.   I hope these teams meet in the WCF.  Should be a fun series to watch.   🍿
PHX	No crying, no sulking, no kicking of chairs, no ripping of jersery, no crazy antics, no showboating! Durant is the greatest Warrior ever!

DEN	Suns is the biggest threat for Nuggets, they want them to win so they can climb up to 6.. if they make it to conference they will face each other, big IF for suns.. or they can meet at 8 vs 1..
