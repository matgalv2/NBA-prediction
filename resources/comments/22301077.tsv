TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Jokic casually gets triple double when he's bored. Congrats Nuggets, great performance by Jokic with his 23rd TD this season, the best center &amp; the best player right now. MVP2024.
	Championship is yet to be determined but the MVP has been clear for a while now. Give the man his trophy.
	He's probably the best eruopean  centre ever
	Its just a matter of time before he does a double triple double
	Allow JOKIC to score and put some pressure to his team mates
	Boston may have the better record, but they ain't beating Joker in a best of 7
	MVP and it’s not even close
	MVP 3 years out of 4
	I love Jokic and would also love to see him play back in the day against other great centers like Shaq, Olajuwon, and Robinson. Would be quite a spectacle
	 is the team to beat in WCF🤔⋯⋯Let’s see which team is going to challenge them 😉
	Nice win. Denver
	Should have been 4 mvp in a row. Never forget
	as much as i don't want to see it, i don't see how Denver doesn't win another title this season
	If this man doesn't win MVP, then nba is rigged.
	4th time MVP in a row
	He is the most effortless player since Jordan
	Was there ever any doubt that Denver would clinch a spot? I never doubted it!
	Boston and Denver. The match we should have had last year
	MVP Jokic ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
	Forget about games double figures; try to get another ring, which is a double accomplishment!

	Best player in the world
	Cleveland Cavaliers Vs Denver Nuggets
	The Lakers be like if this cup could pass from me 😂
	Best Player in the League 🏀⭐ Best Team in the League 🏀⭐
	Jokic nice but What happen against the suns &amp; wolves lol
	Dude is about to break westbrook's record without padding.
	I don’t get it. Why is that so easy for him to keep doing triple doubles ￼
	European is now d best in NBA
	Now the 6 seed in the West will want to be in the play in….
	And we wait to see if the suns or wolves can beat their teams
