TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DEN	Jokic casually gets triple double when he's bored. Congrats Nuggets, great performance by Jokic with his 23rd TD this season, the best center &amp; the best player right now. MVP2024.
DEN	Championship is yet to be determined but the MVP has been clear for a while now. Give the man his trophy.
	Dennis Skief
DEN	He's probably the best eruopean  centre ever
DEN	Its just a matter of time before he does a double triple double
DEN	Allow JOKIC to score and put some pressure to his team mates
DEN	Jason Melanio he's the reason teammates get open looks. best space creator in the game
	Tyler Andrade yeah I know but they can't stop him so instead of focus their defense to him just focus on his team mates
DEN	Boston may have the better record, but they ain't beating Joker in a best of 7
DEN	MVP and it’s not even close
DEN	MVP 3 years out of 4
DEN	I love Jokic and would also love to see him play back in the day against other great centers like Shaq, Olajuwon, and Robinson. Would be quite a spectacle
DEN	🤔⋯⋯Let’s see which team is going to challenge them 😉
	Stan Leko lakersssssss
	Andrew Clark
	Stan Leko absolutely love the nuggets and the Joker.   But that clown Jamal Murray will cost the nuggets a chance at a repeat.
	Stan Leko nobody. That’s who.
	Nice win. Denver
DEN	Should have been 4 mvp in a row. Never forget
DEN	as much as i don't want to see it, i don't see how Denver doesn't win another title this season
DEN	If this man doesn't win MVP, then nba is rigged.

	Was there ever any doubt that Denver would clinch a spot? I never doubted it!
