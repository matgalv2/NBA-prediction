TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Jokic casually gets triple double when he's bored. Congrats Nuggets, great performance by Jokic with his 23rd TD this season, the best center &amp; the best player right now. MVP2024.
	Championship is yet to be determined but the MVP has been clear for a while now. Give the man his trophy.
	Dennis Skief
	He's probably the best eruopean  centre ever
	Its just a matter of time before he does a double triple double
	Allow JOKIC to score and put some pressure to his team mates
	Jason Melanio he's the reason teammates get open looks. best space creator in the game
	Tyler Andrade yeah I know but they can't stop him so instead of focus their defense to him just focus on his team mates
	Boston may have the better record, but they ain't beating Joker in a best of 7
	MVP and it’s not even close
	MVP 3 years out of 4
	I love Jokic and would also love to see him play back in the day against other great centers like Shaq, Olajuwon, and Robinson. Would be quite a spectacle
	🤔⋯⋯Let’s see which team is going to challenge them 😉
	Stan Leko lakersssssss
	Andrew Clark
	Stan Leko absolutely love the nuggets and the Joker.   But that clown Jamal Murray will cost the nuggets a chance at a repeat.
	Stan Leko nobody. That’s who.
	Nice win. Denver
	Should have been 4 mvp in a row. Never forget
	as much as i don't want to see it, i don't see how Denver doesn't win another title this season
	If this man doesn't win MVP, then nba is rigged.
	4th time MVP in a row
	He is the most effortless player since Jordan
	Was there ever any doubt that Denver would clinch a spot? I never doubted it!
	MVP Jokic ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
	Boston and Denver. The match we should have had last year
	Forget about games double figures; try to get another ring, which is a double accomplishment!
	The ultimate stat padder
	☕️
	Best player in the world
	The Lakers be like if this cup could pass from me 😂
	Cleveland Cavaliers Vs Denver Nuggets
	Best Player in the League 🏀⭐ Best Team in the League 🏀⭐
	Jokic nice but What happen against the suns &amp; wolves lol
	Dude is about to break westbrook's record without padding.
	I don’t get it. Why is that so easy for him to keep doing triple doubles ￼
	European is now d best in NBA
	Now the 6 seed in the West will want to be in the play in….
	And we wait to see if the suns or wolves can beat their teams
	He is a beast💪💪💪
	bravo !!!!!

	Jokic -Masterful triple double🤔
	only dwight and mcgee knows how to stop jokic
	Philly fans probably think Embiid is still MVP 😂
	David Silk Let Embiid have his MVP. Joker cares more about the Finals MVP
	David Silk they give embiid the MVP, because he flood the whole arena with his tears if he doesnt.
	Bow down to the new king of triple double
	Always on point 👌🏿
	Denver nuggets will lost in the 1st round🤭🤣😂😄👊👊👊
	Good lord Jokic is talented.
	JOKIC triple double isn't exciting anymore, he does it so frequently, and made to look so easy.
	Luka scored almost 40 at the half
	Congratulations! Nuggets
