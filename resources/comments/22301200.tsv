TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	77 double-doubles in one season! Not a Kings supporter here but Olajuwon go home!
	Igor Płusa not the shot blocker Hakeem was.
SAC	Igor Płusa he also had a ton of triple doubles.  One more assist here and there's another one
SAC	Not enough to beat the Lakers
	Chris Paynter Hey, hello, nice to meet you. Your profile picture is very humorous. Do you always get it like this?
SAC	Chris Paynter check Sabonis record against AD
SAC	Chris Paynter you know we swept the lakers this season right?
	Chris Paynter well we swept the Lakers this year so you never know
	🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
SAC	You were my whole fantasy team this year! My gratitude!💪🏾
SAC	77 double doubles in one season is insane!
SAC	it's always about the individual stats yet they're in play-in 🤣
POR	See You On Next Season Blazers 😭
SAC	Needed one more assist smh ha
SAC	Jayson Raynes I’ve been tracking this since he was here in Indy, and he’s got to be the all-time leader in 9 assist double-doubles.
SAC	Jay Loudermilk yea it's crazy, he's been so automatic all year with dub dubs and averaging 7sts plus, gonna come up short a few games I guess haha
	https://www.statmuse.com/.../players-with-the-most-double...
SAC	Jayson Raynes Easily could have gotten it. The starters got pulled at the beginning of 4th when they were almost up by 50
POR	Allan Poston for sure, he needed to get it first half,  Vegas knew portland would be smashed and starters pulled early by the odds
	Jayson Raynes Hey, hello, nice to meet you. Your profile picture is very humorous. Do you always get it like this?
SAC	Underrated 💪
	No le voy a los Kings pero uff me encanta la shirt ❤️
	#PRAVIMVP
SAC	🔥🔥🔥
SAC	❤️❤️❤️
SAC	Nice 👍🏼
SAC	They get a chance at redemption vs warriors in playin. That game is gonna be a movie I expect both teams to come out hot. It’s gonna be a battle curry is gonna have to drop 40 and others also need to play well as a group but warriors will def prevail but if they gotta match up with lakers idk we are 3-1 on the season but with Ad we don’t have the size to match up with them
SAC	The Kings will lose to the Warriors by 50 points in the Play-In Tournament because they drafted Marvin Bagley III instead of Luka Doncic 😩😭💀🤣
SPAM	p 9 ,
POR	I think Chauncey has to go. Give Scott Brooks the HC job.
SAC	And he was not selected to the All Star Team. 😂 The NBA is a joke.
SAC	Been sitting at 5-6-7 most of the season and ended up 9th. This team choked a lot of games this season and losing in the play-in would be cherry on top.
SAC	Christer Carandang Gee I wonder why they “choked” down the stretch? Could it be because they lost Monk and Huerter?
	Christer Carandang Hey, hello, nice to meet you. Your profile picture is very humorous. Do you always get it like this?
SAC	KinGs want tO oUst the warriors in their hands! That's really what they want, they've waited for this💩🤡🥳😎
SAC	Congratulations to Domantas Sabonis and Sacramento Kings team on the victory
POR	To bad the warriors are gonna end your season lol
POR	🤣🤣🤣
SAC	Eric Sincere hmm did the kings lol
POR	🤣
	👑💜👑💜👑💜👑💜
	Eric Sincere sure didn't❗️
POR	Playing the kings is easy kings lol
	Dan McGaha too*
SAC	One assist shy of a Triple Double
	Ras Carter Hey, hello, nice to meet you. Your profile picture is very humorous. Do you always get it like this?
	Este señor deberia de ser nombrado MVP 💪🏾
SAC	These records mean nothing in playoffs
POR	The Boring Blazers are a joke and Billups is the laziest coach in the NBA who allows his players to be lazy too!
SAC	Domamtas Sabonis
SAC	Domantas Sabonis
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Sacramento Kings
