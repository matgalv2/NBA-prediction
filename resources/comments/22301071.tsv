	What A Good Road Trip Win For The Wolves
	Nuggets lose cuz they don't want to face the Lakers in the first round.
	Congrats!!! MTimberWolves!
	Why is Jokic the M.V.P? they have been 🗑 without Murray this year.
	Back to where we belong first seed☝🏽
	Not a big fan of the way the wolves team is constructed right now, but Ant is a monster and those white unis are clean as hell.
	 this unit plays extremely well together
	Joker not the MVP without Murray !
	Finally posted 🙄
	 oh I know. 😂
	I love  games 🔥 ❤️💪
	Good work Men…
	Wolves are winning it all this season
	Congrats wolves 🐺 !
	Nuggets are heading to a first round exit.
	Nuggets don’t got it this year they got to cocky😂💯
	The NBA can go eat my feces.
	Mike Conley
