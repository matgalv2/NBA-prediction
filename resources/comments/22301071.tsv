	Back on top boys. Definitely will be until the final game to decide the top 3 in the west (maybe more but don't see any 3 failing to win games until then).

	Going to be a battle to end the regular season for those 3 teams for that #1 seed.

	Wolves best seasons since 2004 Kevin Garnett / Sam Cassell era

	The Lal-team..if ever survive in the play in tourn &amp; get the 8th-seed..i like the chances to matchup, wolves or thunder rather than nuggets who hold, 8-0 against Lal-team. As laker fan, i liked this game-result.

	What A Good Road Trip Win For The Wolves
	Nuggets lose cuz they don't want to face the Lakers in the first round.
	Congrats!!! MTimberWolves!
	Why is Jokic the M.V.P? they have been 🗑 without Murray this year.
	Not a big fan of the way the wolves team is constructed right now, but Ant is a monster and those white unis are clean as hell.
	Casey Troyer this unit plays extremely well together
	Back to where we belong first seed☝🏽
	Joker not the MVP without Murray !
	Finally posted 🙄
	I love 🔥 ❤️💪
	Good work Men…
	Wolves are winning it all this season
	Congrats wolves 🐺 !
	Nuggets are heading to a first round exit.
	Nuggets don’t got it this year they got to cocky😂💯
	The NBA can go eat my feces.
	Mike Conley
	Wolves 🥶🐺💪
