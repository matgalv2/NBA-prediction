	Denver Nuggets Vs Memphis Grizzlies
	Still cant believe we lost the #1 seed to the worst team in the west! Thank God we will have home court advantage for at least the first round.
	Brandon Russell hope Braun can stay hot and contribute off the bench. This was a very nice game he had. I think denver will still be fine.
	Brandon Russell Opps ...sorry. 🤣
	Andy Wise lol you clearly dont watch sports. The spurs are the worst team in the west.
	Andy Wise Average OKC reading comprehension
