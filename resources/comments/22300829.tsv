TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
TOR	The Raptors finally won three games in a row so now they get to have their pizza party and they also finally got a win when Scottie has a triple double, it was a good day
	Andrew Stoness I seem to recall Darko was going to take all the team out to dinner if they won 3in a row
TOR	He is playing a whole lot better since he got traded there
	Madison Michael Maddog Fried hi Michael
	Barbara Tailor hi
	Madison Michael Maddog Fried you know I got a few coup of questions I got to ask about the game..  Mind if we chat private
	Barbara Tailor ok
	Madison Michael Maddog Fried hit me up..  I'd hit you up later..  Got to go to bed now..
	Madison Michael Maddog Fried his efficiency has been the biggest improvement!
	Matt Fox yes by far
	Such an encouraging performance by Dick and Abagi!
	Rj a dog, relentless keeps coming at u, the knicks only let Toronto borrow him for a few years , he will be back in New York when he is a finished product
	Playing like a team. Supporting  each other. Hope Poertl isn't out too long.
	Stop winning. we need a top draft pick
	Josh Joseph not in this dumpster fire of a draft.
	Thank former Knicks players!
TOR	Good job well done just keep going with your life you’ll get there.
TOR	This guy can ball....give the team a year to gel and Kelly hopefully stays.
TOR	Not taking anything away from RJ but surely Scottie makes the headline here. Dude had 21 pts, 12 asts, 12 rebs and 5 blocks. Pretty much all over the court.
	Timothy Joseph he got his own headline... they both deserve it!👍🏼🦖🏀🇨🇦🇨🇦
TOR	Congratulations Raptors 🏆🏀
TOR	Way to go Prince RJ😍
	Another good and savy moves by the NY Knicks very good decision and how is OG nuce to here in coming days n months.
TOR	I was so pissed when they traded them, so glad there doing well, but I miss them
TOR	Let's go running for playoffs
TOR	Just wait we will get him back
	Victor Young nope, we're keeping him.🇨🇦🏀🦖👍🏼💪🏽🥳
	Victor Young why would anyone in their right mind want to play for Thibs? He doesn't develop players just rides his starters onto the I.R.
TOR	Way to go Barrett.  Keep up the good works
TOR	Lets go bro!!
	I guess we ain’t getting a top 6 pick now we keep wining 😢
	Justin Saar they are hoping the spurs get there pick this year
	Jordan Maclellan why we are going to be good next year and have shitty pick like 15-20 or getting 6th this year we literally are bouncing back and forth from 6-7
	Jordan Maclellan rather suck this year get the 6th pick
	Justin Saar it is one of the worst drafts in years lol. They want the spurs to get their pick so they have their own next year when there is alot better players
	Jordan Maclellan I know I heard that too
	Justin Saar this draft is shit...
	Nader Moradi a 6th pick in a shit draft is better then 20th pick in a good draft 🤷‍♂️
	Justin Saar what are you talking about...do you even know how this works? We gotta give San Antonio our pick, this year or next....we aren't magically finishing top 10 next season...we can keep our pick in the stronger draft.
	Nader Moradi protected 1-6 till 2027
	Nader Moradi we will be a playoff team next year for sure l. Barnes 22 years old RJ23 quickly 23
	Justin Saar yes exactly ...and us keeping that pick next year is worth way more...win some games..get rid of the pick in this shit draft , develop our young guys in the process...
	Nader Moradi we a year ahead in development getting a guy this draft tho. That’s my opinion. Be nice two first rounders and 31st pick
	Justin Saar that's a pipe dream...we are a play in team at best and even if we get in as 7 or 8 we are toast first round...that will still give us a decent pick...you pay your debts in this world as soon as you can...
	Justin Saar we aren't a year ahead in anything....we have a long way to go..we still need a starting point.. quick is a sg...he isn't a good pg...playoff basketball is half court basketball...we don't have a half court offense, you need a floor general.
	Nader Moradi that’s what my plan was with the 6th pick. I couldn’t agree more
	Justin Saar it's worthless this year...let it go
	Justin Saar we have enough pics in this sorry draft. Worst draft in 20 years. They can have it lol
TOR	Let's go former Knicks 😂
TOR	He’s power forward
TOR	Congratulations Raptors
TOR	Shot bro frm nz
TOR	Thats my boy..my favorite NBA player

IND	What happened to Tyrese Overrated Haliburton?
TOR	RJ Barrett

TOR	Good job!
	Scottie with the triple double!
TOR	Congratulations you won a pointless game you still won't make playoffs.
IND	Seriously ? 😂 Where's Tyrese ? 😂 How's the humble pie tasting ? 🏀✌️
	Mark Serkowski Tyrese is sitting with a winning record. Congrats on your win, you're still miles below .500, so I understand why this is such a big deal for you🤣
	Michael Vance I'm a Bucks fan Einstein 🏀🦌🏆✌️
	Mark Serkowski the Bucks definitely know what being humbled looks like. Tyrese and the Pacers humbled them this season in a major way
TOR	Amazing job
