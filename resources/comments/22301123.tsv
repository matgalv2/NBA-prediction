TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAS	As a Laker fan I could safely say this the only time the spurs have won a game, and I’m happy about it!! 😂😂
SAS	David Berosini they beat the suns twice in the same week
SAS	I love late season magic when teams who have nothing to lose play way harder and mess up decent team’s playoff hopes… 😂
NOP	Dominic Flores heck yes, if you aint good enough to take down a non playoff team, you don't deserve to be in the playoffs.
	I’m just glad I’m not emotionally attached to any teams that are ranked 6-8 right now 😂
SAS	This kid is going to be giving the league fits for the next decade.
SAS	thank you spurs, lakers top 6 continues 🤭
SAS	Thank you san antonio now the 6 and 9th seed are one game away
	Generational talent in the making
SAS	Maxwell Stephens I Already have 6 rookie cards of Wemby…..high ceiling for collectors.
	Maxwell Stephens cuz he's tall?
SAS	Start next season he will be avaraging em tripple doubles…in wins too
SAS	San Antonio throwing a spanner. Lakers or GSW could sneak in
SAS	Legendary hall of famer in the making
SAS	Is there another first round pick they wanna get again? They wanna start winning now lol but wemby is different🔥🔥
SAS	As a Laker fan, Thank you so much for the win spurs and you guys didnt give the win. Thank you thank you thank you.
	Could have lost the game if the Lakers fans did not pray! Spurs should thank the Lakers also, lol!
SAS	Spurs and Dallas Thank you so much. Lakers fans so happy.
SAS	Spurs need PG SG SF and a veteran PF and they will win 🏆
SAS	The Rookie Wemba 🇲🇫❤️🇲🇫
SAS	If it wasn't for him spurs wud never win a game
SAS	DPOY kind of block to end the game! Give it to this dude!
SAS	20 wins this year, 40 wins next year, then we get to playoffs and being championship contenders and then championships. It's a good time to be a spurs fan
SAS	For 5 years this guy hope he will never be injured
SAS	Lmbo I made a build in 2k based of him and this is the number I be getting he's insane
SAS	Give coach popovich a raise! just beat a top 5  playoff team in new Orleans. And had allready won over 20 games with basically rookies. What other coach can say that. This is why he is the Goat. He has 5 rings.
SAS	Honestly he's already top 1 center in the league absolutely, am starting to root for Spurs besides Lakers🤗
SAS	Good one Spurs!! As a Lakers fan i can't thank you enough 😂😂
SAS	The team is playing better without devin tbh.
SAS	It this team had more than Wemby.. theyd be unstoppable. Man needs a point guard and shooting guard and the spurs could have something there.
SAS	Watch out LeBron Your legacy in jeopardy this man the truth.
	What a nice day for lakers
SAS	Excellent game!! So much fun to watch the Spurs bench help win the game!! Go Spurs Go!
SAS	San Antonio Spurs Vs New Orleans Pelicans
	Chicago Bulls please scout this guy for his signature
SAS	Basing on team standing, this should be a punishment to san antonio but it turns out a statement game to the league
SAS	Now just get him that supporting cast that he needs
SAS	Thank you spurs 😂😂😂😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 yours Lakers fan
SAS	Happy for lakers Fan 💪🤗
SAS	As Lakers fan, thank you. 😆
SAS	My boy... Wem, a legit NBA talent...😁
SAS	Congratulations Team Spurs 👏 👏👏👌
SAS	So close in triple double
SAS	I love watching Wemby!!!
	And the Thunder have lost 3 straight now that Chet can't hide behind Shai and J Dub 🫢
	Dan Canong  Exposed,
	Lakers' fans are crazy about Wemby right now. LMAO 😆
	Metee Chaloemkoon why?
	Kevin Dormeyer Cuz his block shot might push the Lakers up to the playoff spot. Not just the play-in tournament.
SAS	👍🏽 thanks 🙏🏽
SAS	THANK YOU 🤩 CELTICS, SPURS and MAVS from LAKERS FANS 💜💛 WE LOVE YOU ALL 😅😂🤣
	He's 7'4 that's not hard  for him
SAS	Victor Wembanyama runs the league. I’m not going to try explaining why. Just watch him play and you’ll see 🔥
SAS	wemby is something.👌stay healthy young man
	Kings lose
SAS	Ballin 😎
SAS	Great game; all ❤️
SAS	Silly game without main Spurs players...but a good win
SAS	He could win ROTY and DPOY at the same time and all of them as a rookie
SAS	Fill the stat sheet Wemby
SAS	Mvp numbers
SAS	They going to get another 1st pick with that record
SAS	Nice ka ahahaha
SAS	You always expect monstrous stats when this fella plays 👏🏽
	Rookie of the year!
	Notice the less points and blocks he gets they actually win .......he make the team worse then last year .
SAS	#GoSpursGo
SAS	Thank you Spurs 💪 🥰🥰🥰
	What an incredible record of 19-58

NOP	Pelicans Don't Play Defense 💯🏀
SAS	Game changer !
	Playing themselves out of a better lottery spot
SAS	Like MJ he is the difference maker
SAS	1 ast shy of a triple double
SAS	Well he has 289 blocks on the season quite impressive .  I wonder if he will ever beat Mark Eaton’s record of 456 blocks in a season 🤔.
SAS	Thanks Wemby
SAS	Just start calling him Victor Winbanyama!
	Record
SAS	Good
SAS	He is a promising teenager.
SAS	They just might reach 20 wins. 😂😂😂
	Yet he allowed Valanciunas of all people to drop 26/7/7 shooting 10-12 while he shot 5-12…if Zion was playing that game wouldn’t have been close.
	Nice photo
	proud of that Guy in France.. hope he'll gonna do much better than TP
	They better next season get him some better players if the spurs wanted to be in the playoffs next season.how you got a weapon like him ain't playing him right. and plus his teammates is bums is bums.get him some better players next season the spurs be in the playoffs it's sad how the spurs went out like that.they better do this next season get him some better players next season.if not. they go have this same situation again.
SAS	Thank you from lakers
SAS	Walking Quadruple W tell me I'm wrong... Everyone hated on him at beginning of year but what now, just like I said at the beginning of the year...Face of the NBA.  I only watch NBA now to see what he does...we've never seen this and he's only gone get … Wyświetl więcej
