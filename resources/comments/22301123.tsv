TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	As a Laker fan I could safely say this the only time the spurs have won a game, and I’m happy about it!! 😂😂
	David Berosini they beat the suns twice in the same week
	I love late season magic when teams who have nothing to lose play way harder and mess up decent team’s playoff hopes… 😂
	Dominic Flores heck yes, if you aint good enough to take down a non playoff team, you don't deserve to be in the playoffs.
	I’m just glad I’m not emotionally attached to any teams that are ranked 6-8 right now 😂
	This kid is going to be giving the league fits for the next decade.
	thank you spurs, lakers top 6 continues 🤭
	Thank you san antonio now the 6 and 9th seed are one game away
	Generational talent in the making
	Maxwell Stephens I Already have 6 rookie cards of Wemby…..high ceiling for collectors.
	Maxwell Stephens cuz he's tall?
	Start next season he will be avaraging em tripple doubles…in wins too
	San Antonio throwing a spanner. Lakers or GSW could sneak in
	Legendary hall of famer in the making
	Is there another first round pick they wanna get again? They wanna start winning now lol but wemby is different🔥🔥
	As a Laker fan, Thank you so much for the win spurs and you guys didnt give the win. Thank you thank you thank you.
	Could have lost the game if the Lakers fans did not pray! Spurs should thank the Lakers also, lol!
	Spurs and Dallas Thank you so much. Lakers fans so happy.
	Spurs need PG SG SF and a veteran PF and they will win 🏆
	The Rookie Wemba 🇲🇫❤️🇲🇫
	If it wasn't for him spurs wud never win a game
	DPOY kind of block to end the game! Give it to this dude!
	20 wins this year, 40 wins next year, then we get to playoffs and being championship contenders and then championships. It's a good time to be a spurs fan
	For 5 years this guy hope he will never be injured
	Lmbo I made a build in 2k based of him and this is the number I be getting he's insane
	Give coach popovich a raise! just beat a top 5  playoff team in new Orleans. And had allready won over 20 games with basically rookies. What other coach can say that. This is why he is the Goat. He has 5 rings.
	Honestly he's already top 1 center in the league absolutely, am starting to root for Spurs besides Lakers🤗
	Good one Spurs!! As a Lakers fan i can't thank you enough 😂😂
	The team is playing better without devin tbh.
	It this team had more than Wemby.. theyd be unstoppable. Man needs a point guard and shooting guard and the spurs could have something there.
	Watch out LeBron Your legacy in jeopardy this man the truth.
	What a nice day for lakers
	Excellent game!! So much fun to watch the Spurs bench help win the game!! Go Spurs Go!
	San Antonio Spurs Vs New Orleans Pelicans
	Chicago Bulls please scout this guy for his signature
	Basing on team standing, this should be a punishment to san antonio but it turns out a statement game to the league
	Now just get him that supporting cast that he needs
	Thank you spurs 😂😂😂😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 yours Lakers fan
	Happy for lakers Fan 💪🤗
	As Lakers fan, thank you. 😆
	My boy... Wem, a legit NBA talent...😁
	Congratulations Team Spurs 👏 👏👏👌
	So close in triple double
	I love watching Wemby!!!
	And the Thunder have lost 3 straight now that Chet can't hide behind Shai and J Dub 🫢
	Dan Canong  Exposed,
	Lakers' fans are crazy about Wemby right now. LMAO 😆
	Metee Chaloemkoon why?
	Kevin Dormeyer Cuz his block shot might push the Lakers up to the playoff spot. Not just the play-in tournament.
	👍🏽 thanks 🙏🏽
	THANK YOU 🤩 CELTICS, SPURS and MAVS from LAKERS FANS 💜💛 WE LOVE YOU ALL 😅😂🤣
	He's 7'4 that's not hard  for him
	Victor Wembanyama runs the league. I’m not going to try explaining why. Just watch him play and you’ll see 🔥
	wemby is something.👌stay healthy young man
	Kings lose
	Ballin 😎
	Great game; all ❤️
	Silly game without main Spurs players...but a good win
	He could win ROTY and DPOY at the same time and all of them as a rookie
	Fill the stat sheet Wemby
	Mvp numbers
	They going to get another 1st pick with that record
	Nice ka ahahaha
	You always expect monstrous stats when this fella plays 👏🏽
	Rookie of the year!
	Notice the less points and blocks he gets they actually win .......he make the team worse then last year .
	#GoSpursGo
	Thank you Spurs 💪 🥰🥰🥰
	What an incredible record of 19-58
	https://youtu.be/lL5CqBgE9dY?si=KZCDCiYfaJyMkxaJ
	Pelicans Don't Play Defense 💯🏀
	Game changer !
	Playing themselves out of a better lottery spot
	Like MJ he is the difference maker
	1 ast shy of a triple double
	Well he has 289 blocks on the season quite impressive .  I wonder if he will ever beat Mark Eaton’s record of 456 blocks in a season 🤔.
	Thanks Wemby 
	Just start calling him Victor Winbanyama!
	Record
	Good
	He is a promising teenager.
	They just might reach 20 wins. 😂😂😂
	Yet he allowed Valanciunas of all people to drop 26/7/7 shooting 10-12 while he shot 5-12…if Zion was playing that game wouldn’t have been close.
	Nice photo
	proud of that Guy in France.. hope he'll gonna do much better than TP
	They better next season get him some better players if the spurs wanted to be in the playoffs next season.how you got a weapon like him ain't playing him right. and plus his teammates is bums is bums.get him some better players next season the spurs be in the playoffs it's sad how the spurs went out like that.they better do this next season get him some better players next season.if not. they go have this same situation again.
	Thank you from lakers
	Walking Quadruple W tell me I'm wrong... Everyone hated on him at beginning of year but what now, just like I said at the beginning of the year...Face of the NBA.  I only watch NBA now to see what he does...we've never seen this and he's only gone get … Wyświetl więcej

	Another of the many OVERRATED players we see hyped these days.    REAL superstar players do not go 19-58.
	Thank you Spurs.
	Generational talent in the making
	He wouldn’t do shyt if it was real centers in the league
	Where is Zion ? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
