	Chet played all 82 games too. I remember people saying he couldn’t hold up for a whole season. Crazy thing is, he’s only getting better and still adjusting
	Great. But I think more experienced teams (Lakers or Warriors) will beat them in the first round. They're more like the Kings last year wherein they fumble in pressure.
	We'll see. Not saying these bottom feeders will win a championship. I am just saying Thunder probably won't win its first round series.
	 they are not playoff-caliber team. Will surely succumb to pressure.
	 such an original take
	OKC and Denver in the WCF would be pretty fun
	I remember EVERYONES COMMENTS “he won’t last 50 games” where are y’all now?
	Shai should be mvp
	"SPURS--- ""you're welcome.""  Lol  good luck in the playoffs."
	They need to represent that #1 seed.  Congratulations OKC.
	thats good news for the 8th seed
	This shows that MAV's are nothing without Luka. That's why he should be the MVP.
	Y'all need to chill 🤣 It was the bottom 3rd of our bench against their starting five. This was expected. Mavs in 6!
	I pity fans who spent time and hard earned money to see their favorite players play and sadly didn’t suit up.
	All fun and games until LeBron sweeps OKC or the Timberpups in the first round 😩😭💀🤣
	The Thunder will get swept by the #8 seed, unless they get the Kings.
	Mavs other other strategic plans.
	I hope lakers be the eight seed,if they are 7th they will face denver in the first round, and we know game over denver wins. Not discounting okc but they are a young team more seasons to grow. Now is the time to give lebron and ad their 18th ring for la
	Did the mavs even try? 😂😂
	I just hope OKC learned from their mistake and won't break the core of the team like they did with KD's team.
	Did we play the backups?
	SGA should be MVP... no all star on his team and they are #1 seed
	How hysterical would it be should The Lakers lose their next two games?
	No.1 in the regular season but play off is different...
	Well deserved and congrats to them
	1st round exit respectfully
	okay²x class😅 our lessons for today is about OKC THUNDER😁✌ its about the (Canadian,Australian and the Young Chet😅👍) 1 Round Playoffs Exit Vow😆✌
	Thank the Mavs for setting their starters and being strategic.
	Everyone sleeping on this young squad, but they are well coached,  a lot of fight and really good players.
	The mavs had all their nobodies on the court. Great win for them though.
	Jason Kidd is SOFT. Mavs could have gotten #4 seed if he wasnt so scared.
	I think I speak for all basketball fans when I say I pray they don’t break this young thunder team up like they did they first!!
	Literaly the bench warmers against their starting 5🤣
	Watch OKC get swept or beat by the Lakers to add to the legacy😂
	These guys are so young too. Imagine this core next year.
	If GSW win.this will be a big upset
	I'm just here to read all of the,.
	If Okc comes out of the west, I'm rooting for them. For now, i think their ceiling is 2nd round
	In the West, they are avoiding to play the 7th and 8th teams in a 7 game series.
	I’m telling you playoffs hit different the winner is from 6 seed to 10 seed
	Wait for LeBron to send Chet back in injury🤣
	Lakers vs okc 1st round
	First round exit😂
	1st round exit.
	Kyrie and Luka ain’t play relax
	Who’s going to be the mvp
	OKC vs GSW... hopefully...
	played more games than LePeds
	Where's wemby his the alien right 😁
	SGA should be MVP but the media gone rob him
	And they’re still sitting on 47 future 1st round picks. Crazy stuff…
	Reminds me of the Jazz teams of 3-4 years ago when they were the 1 seed, very similar in a lot ways including not getting past the 2nd round. Feel free to come back to this post if you think I’m a 🤡
	No way!!!!okc team this year is packed with talents if no one is injured in this group even the experience team they can compete
	Rookie of the year 💪
	All the play in teams are capable of beating this team to a 7 games series
	Nice okc onway to a first round exit
	A game where the mvp didn't even play
	Mavs got mashed. Did they sit their guys? What happened?
	Kyrie And Luka Couldn’t Have Played
	No bearing game.
	super impressive!
	Mavs choice to be lost😅
	The Mavs dominated them at full strength. These kids aren’t a threat🤣
	Lakers in 5
	Chet 4 Roy
	Congratulations Thunder team and fans on the victory
	I think It’s time for Jimmy Butler to have his early vacation this time
	All this to not even win a series lol nuggets getting that back 2 back champs
	Lakers in 5
	If the lakers dont sweep the thunder, i cant wait for the mavs to do it in the second round after shai gets more mvp votes than luka
	Warriors in 5
	Let’s go boys!!!!!!
	"Thank Jebus the LeFlop era is finally coming to an end. He can stack all the stats he wants and pay for his underachieving children to make an NBA roster, but it's time for a new generation to take the game to the next level.
