TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
OKC	Chet played all 82 games too. I remember people saying he couldn’t hold up for a whole season. Crazy thing is, he’s only getting better and still adjusting
DAL	Great. But I think more experienced teams (Lakers or Warriors) will beat them in the first round. They're more like the Kings last year wherein they fumble in pressure.
OKC	We'll see. Not saying these bottom feeders will win a championship. I am just saying Thunder probably won't win its first round series.
OKC	Kenneth Javier they are not playoff-caliber team. Will surely succumb to pressure.
	Kenneth Javier such an original take
	OKC and Denver in the WCF would be pretty fun
OKC	I remember EVERYONES COMMENTS “he won’t last 50 games” where are y’all now?
OKC	"SPURS--- ""you're welcome.""  Lol  good luck in the playoffs."
OKC	They need to represent that #1 seed.  Congratulations OKC.
OKC	Jamie Caldwell no. 1. But they cannot win the championship.
OKC	Ed Garcia I don't think they'll win it all either.
	thats good news for the 8th seed
	Shai should be mvp
OKC	All fun and games until LeBron sweeps OKC or the Timberpups in the first round 😩😭💀🤣
DAL	This shows that MAV's are nothing without Luka. That's why he should be the MVP.
OKC	The Thunder will get swept by the #8 seed, unless they get the Kings.
DAL	Y'all need to chill 🤣 It was the bottom 3rd of our bench against their starting five. This was expected. Mavs in 6!
OKC	Zach Fontenot okc literally emptied the end of their bench. The starters played like 12 minutes. But tell yourself whatever you need to feel better about it I guess.
DAL	Mark Burnett 8 best mavs players were not even on the bench lol. Most of these players will not get a minute of playing time in the playoffs.
DAL	I pity fans who spent time and hard earned money to see their favorite players play and sadly didn’t suit up.
	Jerico Leo lahi ra jd si kobe
DAL	Jerico Leo if ur old enough to spend ur money on these games then your old enough to look at playoff scenarios and understand that teams aren’t going to play their players in meaningless games
DAL	Mavs other other strategic plans.
DAL	Daniel Grey they already clinched their seed
	I hope lakers be the eight seed,if they are 7th they will face denver in the first round, and we know game over denver wins. Not discounting okc but they are a young team more seasons to grow. Now is the time to give lebron and ad their 18th ring for la
DAL	Did the mavs even try? 😂😂
DAL	Ben Folekene Mavs had their spot sealed. They had nothing to gain.
DAL	Ben Folekene they rested everybody
OKC	I just hope OKC learned from their mistake and won't break the core of the team like they did with KD's team.
	Christin Noëlli Mong this roster probably won't win a Championship, there likely will be adjustments needed. In Presti We Trust.
	Robert Schafer some adjustments but they should keep the core
	Did we play the backups?
DAL	Myron Magee No Kyrie, Luka, PJ, Gafford, Lively, Exum, DJJ, etc.. lol
DAL	Myron Magee yes every single one of them. They rested the starters.
OKC	SGA should be MVP... no all star on his team and they are #1 seed
	Jimmie Floyd Their other starters missed a total of 17 games and J is an All Star.  Compare that to the Mavs whose starters missed closer to 125. Luka better in all categories. SGA was great but Luka was just flat out better
OKC	Paul Bovi We've seen Luka b4.. his name is James Harden. SGA has the youngest team in the league and they are #1 in the West
DAL	Jimmie Floyd Luka is 25 years old. He has gotten better every year. He has better stats than SGA in every offensive category while OKC clearly has better players who actually played unlike the Mavs. Outside of Kyrie, Mavs have next to nothing. Brother thing maybe?
	How hysterical would it be should The Lakers lose their next two games?
OKC	No.1 in the regular season but play off is different...
	okay²x class😅 our lessons for today is about OKC THUNDER😁✌ its about the (Canadian,Australian and the Young Chet😅👍) 1 Round Playoffs Exit Vow😆✌
OKC	Well deserved and congrats to them
DAL	Thank the Mavs for setting their starters and being strategic.
OKC	1st round exit respectfully
OKC	Everyone sleeping on this young squad, but they are well coached,  a lot of fight and really good players.
	Raymond Elliott against the mavs 3rd string? Nahhh. This okc squad is 1st round exit
DAL	The mavs had all their nobodies on the court. Great win for them though.
DAL	Jason Kidd is SOFT. Mavs could have gotten #4 seed if he wasnt so scared.
DAL	Leo Tato ah yes. Dallas could be the fifth seed and play the Clippers. However, they could also go big for the fourth seed and play the... *squints* Clippers. So much to play for.
OKC	Marc Sincich you play for home court advantage. Learn the game.
OKC	I think I speak for all basketball fans when I say I pray they don’t break this young thunder team up like they did they first!!
OKC	Derris Sticko this roster probably won't win a Championship, there likely will be adjustments needed. In Presti We Trust.
	🫡
OKC	Derris Sticko we are in agreement on this, they will keep that core. There is a lot of fan sentiment that any changes are going to be a mistake. This is a process not yet complete.
OKC	Watch OKC get swept or beat by the Lakers to add to the legacy😂
OKC	These guys are so young too. Imagine this core next year.
DAL	In the West, they are avoiding to play the 7th and 8th teams in a 7 game series.
DAL	Literaly the bench warmers against their starting 5🤣
	If GSW win.this will be a big upset
OKC	If Okc comes out of the west, I'm rooting for them. For now, i think their ceiling is 2nd round
	"I'm just here to read all of the,""first round loss, to the Lakers or Warriors,"" comments, 😊."
OKC	I’m telling you playoffs hit different the winner is from 6 seed to 10 seed
	Lakers vs okc 1st round
	Wait for LeBron to send Chet back in injury🤣
	First round exit😂
	1st round exit.
DAL	Kyrie and Luka ain’t play relax
OKC	Highend Chop because they had nothing to gain. OKC clinched the 1 seed.
	Chance Janssen exactly
	Who’s going to be the mvp
	Erick Merioles Jokic
	OKC vs GSW... hopefully...
	played more games than LePeds
	Where's wemby his the alien right 😁
OKC	SGA should be MVP but the media gone rob him
OKC	And they’re still sitting on 47 future 1st round picks. Crazy stuff…
	Reminds me of the Jazz teams of 3-4 years ago when they were the 1 seed, very similar in a lot ways including not getting past the 2nd round. Feel free to come back to this post if you think I’m a 🤡
OKC	No way!!!!okc team this year is packed with talents if no one is injured in this group even the experience team they can compete
OKC	Rookie of the year 💪
OKC	All the play in teams are capable of beating this team to a 7 games series
OKC	Nice okc onway to a first round exit
DAL	A game where the mvp didn't even play
DAL	Mavs got mashed. Did they sit their guys? What happened?
DAL	Chad Austin mavs starting 5 did not play. This game has no bearing for them as they already locked at 5th regardless.
	Michael De Jesus Diwa ok thanks, figured it was something like that
DAL	Kyrie And Luka Couldn’t Have Played
	No bearing game.
OKC	super impressive!
DAL	Mavs choice to be lost😅
	😂😂😂pag gsw or lakers makalaban nyan... 😂😂😂
DAL	The Mavs dominated them at full strength. These kids aren’t a threat🤣
	Lakers in 5
OKC	Chet 4 Roy
OKC	Congratulations Thunder team and fans on the victory
	I think It’s time for Jimmy Butler to have his early vacation this time
	All this to not even win a series lol nuggets getting that back 2 back champs
	Lakers in 5
OKC	If the lakers dont sweep the thunder, i cant wait for the mavs to do it in the second round after shai gets more mvp votes than luka
	Warriors in 5
OKC	Let’s go boys!!!!!!
	Thank Jebus the LeFlop era is finally coming to an end. He can stack all the stats he wants and pay for his underachieving children to make an NBA roster, but it's time for a new generation to take the game to the next level. Hopefully he'll slip off into a peaceful retirement and leave the game alone altogether when his son(s) flop. 🙏🏻
OKC	Haden Thompson the rebuild has done us
	Denver running it back
	Boston is 64-18
	Okc vs GS, Kings, LA, or Pelicans ??
