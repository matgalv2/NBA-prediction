TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	It is absolutely a amazing turned around for the MAVS 
	I’m not saying he’s the best ever, but I’ve never seen a player who makes the game of basketball look easier, and have so much fun while doing it.
	Tristan Gagne agree. he’s so fun to watch.
	Heat Culture??……
	The best Luka .. a great man
	David Ajster yes you right MVP
	Hany Efendy MVP.
	16-2 in their last 18 games with the #1 defense in the league in that stretch. Media gonna overlook the Mavs tomorrow per usual.
	Joey Gomez that fine. Media obsessed with Lakers tbh
	Joey Gomez good. Don't change a thing. Let the Mavs cook.
	They still not beating us in the playoffs I don’t care if he got Kyrie harden will be the X factor in this series mavericks got no one that can match him
	Maaaaan I'm a loyal HEAT fan. As a fan of the game, it's freakin awesome to see this franchise come up again, and Luka was way, overdue for some help.
	Again just short of a triple double, he’s had that stat line so many times this year. #Lukamvp
	2011 run incoming?
	😭😂 don’t smoke
	🧢🧢 Kyrie put that work in! luka was in foul trouble most of the game.
	Did you see the Denver  Wolves game ,the reffs were the worst and they will reff the playoffs too,
	When you shoot it 38 times you think he should have more than 29😁😁
	👍🏻 And yeah this was an “off” night in terms of efficiency but they won, easily so…… what’s your point.
	😁😁￼
	Michael Moya Haha what does Lebron have to do with it? Luka shoots twice as many 3’s as Lebron at 38%. Their true shooting numbers are within 1% of each other, but Luka has more assists, steals, blocks, free throws….. just say you don’t like Luka but don’t pull out stats….
	Ben Jousan wrong! I kinda like Luca and I can’t stand LeBron. But I’m a nuggets fan so you know who I think the best basketball player is ￼
	😑
	Mavs could go far there sleepers
	Dallas vs Clippers playoffs?
	Harold Arañas Cabellon yesssssss hahaha game 3 watch ko
	Sari Malik watch ta Ross Dian  ayaw ko biyae hahahahah
	Harold Arañas Cabellon hahahaha karong April na start sa playoffs.
	Sari Malik diba december pa??
	Harold Arañas Cabellon April na..hahaha
	You deserve the mvp
	So nice play by mavs
	Triple double heartbreak
	Faded Heat, oppo. last year, Bkk super hot, splashing water started.
	Needed 1 more of everything lol
	Magic Donci MVP 🇨🇴

	Mvp

	West Finals: Clippers vs Nuggets
	Keep on sleeping on the Mavs! They will surprise everyone.
	#50
	Give him the mvp already ! Best player in league
	Impressive 16-4 run! Good luck Mavs!!
	If Bron put that stat line up he'd be accused of stat padding and being washed
	You know what? This guy good
	"Luka had to deal with a far more injured roster, a roster revamp mid season, has Career high in PPG, SPG, APG, DR, FT%, 3PT%, MPG, Top 7 in Steals, top 10 in Post defense, 2nd greatest season in NBA history with PPG+APG+RPG and greater than Jokic's last 2 MVP runs, first ever 33-8-8 season, plays through worse injuries, 1st in Player of month awards, 1st in player of the week awards, most doubled player in the NBA by a significant margin, top 20 scoring season ever, 1st player to be top 20 in points, rebounds, assists AND steals, 1st in PPG, 2nd in APG, top 20 in RPG as a PG, MOST PPG in NBA history without FTM (27.0 PPG) and Jokic isnt even top 20 of all time, 2nd in 3PM, most 30 PT triple doubles since Russ' MVP, 1st player in NBA history with 6 consecutive triple doubles, Mavs have a losing record without him unlike Jokic, Mavs would be 2nd in the East with 20 above .500. Even Jokic admitted that Luka is the ""100%"" obvious MVP, there's nothing more he can do and its more than obvious his season has been better this year. Does the most for his team with the highest usage, 8 more PPG than Jokic, #1 clutch record and team in the NBA, Luka performs better in the Clutch, most used lineup for the Mavs has played less than 200 minutes, Jokic has had over 900 minutes, Literally and statistically better offensively AND defensively and is playing with significantly more adversity. Luka is the MVP 🔥🔥🔥"
	50 wins for the Dallas Mavericks.
	When 29, 9 &amp; 9 actually lowers your averages across the board 😅
	mavs defense is crazy bruh... I never seen a mavs team that played defense like this.
	Aww, looks like he is holding hands with Bam.  😆 🤣
	Doncic's season at age 25 is better than MJ's:
	That's a great picture of you and God bless you 😇🙏
	mavs vs lakers
	Triple double heart break
	Mavs vs Clippers 1st round #NBAPlayoffs take your pick?
	Kyries 25 points of 10/15 fga 5/8 from 3s compared to lucas 29 points of 9/23 4/15 from 3s oh common bro its not fair🤣🤣✌
	Mavs in 5 🥱
	I knew I should’ve put that bet on
	Thanks for helping Philly out
	Dallas Mavericks Vs Miami Heat
	Yessss
	Things are kind tough atm especially this time of the year so I’m gifting 7 grands to the first 10 people to message me with “TOUGH” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.❤️
	Ready for title
	Without Luka and Kyree the mavericks stink.  No bench.
	Making money is a skill I'll teach you how to master the process inside the real world TRW Hustlers University
	Gifting 5 grands to the first five people to hit me up “GOD IS GOOD “ Y’all stay blessed
