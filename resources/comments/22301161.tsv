	It is absolutely a amazing turned around for the MAVS 
	I’m not saying he’s the best ever, but I’ve never seen a player who makes the game of basketball look easier, and have so much fun while doing it.
	 agree. he’s so fun to watch.
	Heat Culture??……
	The best Luka .. a great man
	 yes you right MVP
	 MVP.
	They still not beating us in the playoffs I don’t care if he got Kyrie harden will be the X factor in this series mavericks got no one that can match him
	16-2 in their last 18 games with the #1 defense in the league in that stretch. Media gonna overlook the Mavs tomorrow per usual.
	 that fine. Media obsessed with Lakers tbh
	 good. Don't change a thing. Let the Mavs cook.
	Maaaaan I'm a loyal HEAT fan. As a fan of the game, it's freakin awesome to see this franchise come up again, and Luka was way, overdue for some help.
	Again just short of a triple double, he’s had that stat line so many times this year. 
	2011 run incoming?
	 😭😂 don’t smoke
	When you shoot it 38 times you think he should have more than 29😁😁
	 Haha you had to make up a fake stat. Try 23 attempts 👍🏻 And yeah this was an “off” night in terms of efficiency but they won, easily so…… what’s your point.
	 stupid comment 😑
	Did you see the Denver  Wolves game ,the reffs were the worst and they will reff the playoffs too,
	🧢🧢 Kyrie put that work in! luka was in foul trouble most of the game.
	Mavs could go far there sleepers
	Dallas vs Clippers playoffs?
	Mvp
	Needed 1 more of everything lol
	So nice play by mavs
	Faded Heat, oppo. last year, Bkk super hot, splashing water started.
	You deserve the mvp
	Triple double heartbreak
	Magic Donci MVP 🇨🇴

	West Finals: Clippers vs Nuggets
	So did Kyrie
	Keep on sleeping on the Mavs! They will surprise everyone.
	#50
	Impressive 16-4 run! Good luck Mavs!!
	Give him the mvp already ! Best player in league
	If Bron put that stat line up he'd be accused of stat padding and being washed
	You know what? This guy good
	50 wins for the Dallas Mavericks.
	mavs defense is crazy bruh... I never seen a mavs team that played defense like this.
	When 29, 9 &amp; 9 actually lowers your averages across the board 😅
	"Luka had to deal with a far more injured roster, a roster revamp mid season, has Career high in PPG, SPG, APG, DR, FT%, 3PT%, MPG, Top 7 in Steals, top 10 in Post defense, 2nd greatest season in NBA history with PPG+APG+RPG and greater than Jokic's las… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Aww, looks like he is holding hands with Bam.  😆 🤣

	Doncic's season at age 25 is better than MJ's:
	Triple double heart break
	Mavs vs Clippers 1st round  take your pick?
	Mavs in 5 🥱
	Things are kind tough atm especially this time of the year so I’m gifting 7 grands to the first 10 people to message me with “TOUGH” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.❤️
	Kyries 25 points of 10/15 fga 5/8 from 3s compared to lucas 29 points of 9/23 4/15 from 3s oh common bro its not fair🤣🤣✌
	I knew I should’ve put that bet on
	Dallas Mavericks Vs Miami Heat
	Thanks for helping Philly out
	Yessss

	Without Luka and Kyree the mavericks stink.  No bench.
