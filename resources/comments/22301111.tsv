	I told him to go after every rebound. He thought I was joking. He ended up one rebound short of a triple double. Young dudes have to learn how to listen 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
	Too bad maxey.Heat want to win bigg
	 can I use one of your pictures as mural art,🫶am currently on a project and you will be paid and credited for it?
	The real MVP when he back, the team back too. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
	My prediction is 76ers is  impossible for finals, I prefer for miami if they are only complete
	Depuis Joël est de retour c’est 2 matchs 2 victoires
	Tyler Herro ainda não estava em quadra ... talvez a gente possa rever nos playoffs
	UK guards 💪
	He has incredible potential
	Underpaid so sad for him

	Excellent!
	Embiid is back!!
	Maxey, you were on 🔥!You proved to everyone that you are an ALL-STAR⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ You also demonstrated that you are a team leader!❤️
	Fun game 🙌🏽
	Miami beat themselves... they keep choking in the 4th
	Tyrese maxey es un fenómeno
	Bam and Rozier with the -29 and -24 differential in a 4pt lead game. 😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️
	Nahhh, just bad rotation from heat and coaching staff.. rozier a pure ballhug
	Near Triple Double for Tyrese Maxey
	 vratio se Embiid, Sixersi pobjeđuju opet i to ozbiljne ekipe..
	 On je pola ekipe, nema tu puno mudrovanja. Ali, i dalje su #8 no imaju šanse da se vrate u 6.
	 i bogme i vratit će se u PO zonu, sve mi se čini..
	Tyrese Maxey
	Love my 76ers❤️💙🏀
