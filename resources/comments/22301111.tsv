	I told him to go after every rebound. He thought I was joking. He ended up one rebound short of a triple double. Young dudes have to learn how to listen 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
	Joel simply make this man better
	He play simple but deadly ...rising star in the making hopefully he stay healthy ...gsw fan all the way from pilipinas
	Too bad maxey.Heat want to win bigg
	🫶am currently on a project and you will be paid and credited for it?
	Tyler Herro ainda não estava em quadra ... talvez a gente possa rever nos playoffs
	The real MVP when he back, the team back too. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
	My prediction is 76ers is  impossible for finals, I prefer for miami if they are only complete
	He has incredible potential
	UK guards 💪
	Depuis Joël est de retour c’est 2 matchs 2 victoires
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Miami Heat

	Where is Embiid ....???
	Coach Chris He came back last game but still looked a bit iffy. They're probably saving him for the play-in/playoffs.
	Michael Edward Miller Jr. ok he's a good player I like him and I like his games
	Michael Edward Miller Jr. he played over 30 mins
	Ok. I see what he’s doing here. He’s yawning he’s sleepie
	Let’s gooo!
	congrats sixers 😇😍
	😢
	It’s always a none all star that claps us 😭😭😭
	Jeffrey Carter who is a non all star?
	Michael Usiayo Maxey a all star clearly but like it’s never the best player on a team who torches us it’s always second or thirst best player
	😂 he didn’t clap us we gave up the lead(s) plain and simple
	Tanner Lee Coryell ya but Maxey went crazy ain’t nobody guarded him last few minutes it’s pretty embarrassing
	💩 makes no sense
	Tanner Lee Coryell sure
	💩🤡🧑‍🦯
	👀👀👀
	Tanner Lee Coryell read my above comment I should have said superstar instead. Lol
	Jeffrey Carter literally became one this year lol
	Lucas McCoy go read my other comments

	Jeffrey Carter Maxey was an all star this year
	Excellent!
	Maxey, you were on 🔥!You proved to everyone that you are an ALL-STAR⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ You also demonstrated that you are a team leader!❤️
	Embiid is back!!
	Fun game 🙌🏽
	Miami beat themselves... they keep choking in the 4th
	Bam and Rozier with the -29 and -24 differential in a 4pt lead game. 😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️
	Tyrese maxey es un fenómeno
	Near Triple Double for Tyrese Maxey
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović vratio se Embiid, Sixersi pobjeđuju opet i to ozbiljne ekipe..
	Ante Boban On je pola ekipe, nema tu puno mudrovanja. Ali, i dalje su #8 no imaju šanse da se vrate u 6.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović i bogme i vratit će se u PO zonu, sve mi se čini..
	Nahhh, just bad rotation from heat and coaching staff.. rozier a pure ballhug
	Love my 76ers❤️💙🏀
