PHI	Where is Embiid ....???
MIA	Coach Chris He came back last game but still looked a bit iffy. They're probably saving him for the play-in/playoffs.

	Michael Usiayo Maxey a all star clearly but like it’s never the best player on a team who torches us it’s always second or thirst best player
MIA	😂 he didn’t clap us we gave up the lead(s) plain and simple
	Tanner Lee Coryell ya but Maxey went crazy ain’t nobody guarded him last few minutes it’s pretty embarrassing

	Edževid Ecko Redžepović vratio se Embiid, Sixersi pobjeđuju opet i to ozbiljne ekipe..
	Ante Boban On je pola ekipe, nema tu puno mudrovanja. Ali, i dalje su #8 no imaju šanse da se vrate u 6.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović i bogme i vratit će se u PO zonu, sve mi se čini..
