TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAL	All fun and games until LeBron sweeps OKC or the Timberpups in the first round 😩😭💀🤣
LAL	another stressful day to lbj haters 🤣🤣🤣
LAL	He completely shut Zion down on the defensive end, too. Just an insane performance after this many seasons/minutes.
LAL	I think it's safe to say that the GOAT debate is over.
LAL	The GOAT, no doubt.
LAL	Another stressful news for all the haters. 🥴
	Rematch Denver vs Lakers 1st round. 😅
LAL	They just need to win last game so that whoever wins in gsw vs kings, they will still be 8th. Its imperative to win so that they have a chance for 7th in play in. If they lose this, the last position for them is 8th which is against jokic lol
LAL	The goat all the way
LAL	Lebron is the GOAT at the age of 39!!
LAL	Great win, let's carry that momentum into finals!!
	Chris Paynter Hey, hello, nice to meet you. Your profile picture is very humorous. Do you always get it like this?
	Chris Paynter I hope
LAL	37yrs. I'm always gonna put mj upfront. But LBJ longevity and hes trying to conserve his burst at certain points in the game is brady like.my bad I'm writing drunk
LAL	Great game by LeBron James . Hoping to duplicate it for the 7th seed and a rematch with Nuggets
LAL	It’s something bout that 3rd q lakers don’t like lol almost every game they slow down in the 3rd but good win
LAL	King LBJ  is the Greatest player to ever play basketball👑😎
LAL	Funny how we go hard in this kind of game but sir vs Boston, Clipper etc. stay grabbin to the fullest. Do this in the playoffs.
LAL	The lakers are putting on a good run last few games, gotta respect the effort &amp; grit bron still has it in him aft all these years.
LAL	Almost 40 still playing this way probably will never be seen again. As a true basketball I will not take this for granted.
LAL	The NBA is so rigged for LBJ. It is so blatantly obvious.
LAL	If the Lakers can Beat that Nuggets in the 1st round... Lakers will have a chance to get the Championship🏆🏀🫡
LAL	It must be hard for someone to hate another person for the entire 21 years with no signs of stopping any time soon..
	Leo Mahapang they find satisfaction doing it all their life. Never expect appreciation, they've none of it.
NOP	🤣
	🤦🏽‍♂️
LAL	We are winning this tournament also 👏 🙌🏾
LAL	Say what you want, but today LeBron wanted this win and earned it
LAL	what a performance at age 39, 21 years in the league and of course haters will always find a way to bash this dude..a tripple double and a win😬 such a ridiculous player🤦
	Omar Dizon II they forgot to post his flop stats .
LAL	Wow lbj grabi age 39 still amazing dunk still dominant still prime still MVP still best ever the superhumangoat 🌟
LAL	LeBron, lol. He sat out a game for load management, meantime, if he played one more game this season he would have made another record, most missed field goals in NBA history
LAL	Appreciate greatness LBJ
LAL	And @ 39yrs of age, LBJ is amazing in his 21st season.
LAL	Congrats lakers and LBJ 👏💪
LAL	wow big size playmaker  17 assist
LAL	Thunder vs. Lakers in the 1st Round
	Los Angeles Lakers Vs New Orleans Pelicans
LAL	❤️🥰
LAL	Lakers win ❤️
LAL	9 ast in 1st quarter . 😁😁
	Jerico Marvin Quicho ginanahan kuys hahaha
	Johnlou Tyndale kung manalo sa play-in. Denver agad kalaban. Palag palag lakers na nyan. Lebron pa ba
	Jerico Marvin Quicho hahahaha walangya trauma na sa denver pero panigurado iba na laruan nyan
	Johnlou Tyndale uu iba na laruan niyan. Di na papayag lebron na matalo pa sila ulit haha. Mas okay nang manalo sa play-in. Safe na
LAL	Triple double..what a nice game💪💪💪
LAL	Lakers 2024 nba champions
LAL	This is the reason why LeBron will always be light years better than Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan would be Philippine Basketball Association import level without Rodman and Pippen’s help and Phil Jackson’s coaching.
LAL	That’s why he’s the GOAT! 17 assists and 28 points on very efficient shooting. Don’t think another player wearing No 23 ever did that. I dare say it again! Before his career is over he’ll be the number one scorer All-Time and at least Number 3 in assist. If that ain’t the GOAT then no one is. 🙌🫶👏👌❤️ Hail to the King!
LAL	Rookie of the year candidate
LAL	The game became soft..what do you expect
LAL	What a monster performance. Imagine lolobron  28 pts with 17 assist he like 25yrs old..
	Boylie D. Baui prang kw lang din yan insan
LAL	😂
	All haters to the podium
	Pwenersa n Lolo 😃😃
	Renan Tabios alam
	😃😃kaya na mewersa na😆
LAL	That's why he is the Goat 🐐
LAL	Greatest Player of all time
LAL	I didn't know Lebron already has 3 peat. 🤣🤣🤣
LAL	I can't imagine the face of the haters now, that they've been hating for the past 21 seasons😫😱😭🤣
NOP	No bearing game..The play-off picture is already settled..The Pelicans already secured their place in the playoffs so why risk 'injury' to their 'stars'..Part of the game..
	Lakers vs Nuggets 1st round will be great.
LAL	Stop that debate we dont have benifits whoever becomes great player for they are only playing for money and fame..  they play because they are paid..
LAL	Please lose vs the pelicans lakers ! Would much rather play OKC in the first round than Denver
LAL	LBJ is really awesome bball player n team L.A. Lakers win against Pelican.!!!
LAL	Great points, assist, reb,&amp; still,👑💪👌
NOP	As I said before, Pelicans has no place beating experienced teams. The same thing could be said for Thunder and T-Wolves. I hope I'm wrong
LAL	"It's funny how a ""lesser"" player like Austin Reaves finishes his work season playing all 82 games. While the supposed Mr. Longevity and Mr. Records barely has any full seasons in his long career. No, don't argue his age now. He had plenty times to do i… Wyświetl więcej"
LAL	LBJ 21 years...3 time sweep...
	I wonder how much the refs help them fr lol now all the media gonna say they gonna win it all right lol
LAL	Alright!! Let's go !! 'bron 💪💪 Lakers win 💪💪
LAL	game was almost unwatchable, poor coaching from wilie green , Bron with AD pick and roll is to complicated for him as coach.. Austin Reaves look like Larry Bird against McCullum and Chose  😃
LAL	Good for LeBron he's pretty good for a grandpa. ❤️
LAL	Whether you are a fan or a hater, his professional attitude is an inspiration. 👑
LAL	only magic could play pg like this, not leave out my beast Westbrook but he doesnt have the size
LAL	Congratulations Lakers 💜💛💪
LAL	Lakers need to lose in the 1st play in game then win for the 8th seed so they don't meet the nuggets right away. It's their kryptonite.
LAL	No, the referees handed LeBron James the ball at the foul line. Stop trying to make this a story that it wasn't. The referees gave the Lakers twice as many foul shots as the Pelicans and they won by less than that. The better team the entire game was the Pelicans. Look at the stats. That's the story. The game was rigged.
LAL	I do like that Bosley hair for men, has supported LeFlop and sponsors him
LAL	No one can great this basketball player ever the KING👑👑 GOAT.
LAL	Nice with the tripple-double, but let's not quickly forget that AD frontlined Laker's team with that 30 PTS. Man's been on fire, a great hooper. But LBJ is goat, that can't be argued. Still racking up the stats at 39.
LAL	all of this will come. To an end as they face the Kryptonite The Joker and Playoff mode Jamal Murray.
LAL	Good luck 🍀👍🏼
LAL	Those stats are crazy and the defense the stats don't show 🔥
NOP	Sad thing is, CJ is the NBA Players President,  far more respected than LeTrade, but never get recognition. I suppose if you don't bring in superstars (cough cough Davis) it is sort of unimaginable to be seen. 49 wins over 47 with Not a single AllStar ... yikes LA
LAL	Lebron is the true goat and king!! This season he is breaking records every time he steps in the court. I am enjoying every minute of this historical run.
	Still hasn’t 3peated twice yet
	Year 21
LAL	4swept in the nba history and king of flopping king of turnover also king of airball..yahahahahaha
LAL	Congrats Lakers I how A,D, is going to be ok,👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️🏀
LAL	👍🏾❤️
LAL	of course. He sat out so he could rest as he does prior to the playoffs while others had to play
LAL	Even your not the goat, but you are the king.... Better scoring, assisst, rebound, and chase block than the goat,. That epic 3-1 comeback against the best record in nba in championship. The kings team defeated the  team that has the best record in nba, while the goat team is the second best record in nba,
	My GOAT King James,  congrats lakers.
NOP	An entire game of sick dimes.
LAL	I love the 😄 reactions
LAL	I wish sports comments were only limited to USA citizens 🙄
	Scores are this high because no one plays Defense, the NBA is not good basketball , it’s a joke league
LAL	You guys Need to Respect LeBron James ..💯🔥💯,. ... it's just that Simple.. very simple..
LAL	7 assists in the 1st 4 minutes of the game!! He's so good it's insane!!
LAL	Well games, but davis seen like injury...
LAL	A road game, what else the haters can say?
LAL	I think Lebron is the GOAT.
LAL	Gifted player ...ever...the king 👑 James
LAL	Outstanding performance for a guy who leads a Play-in team!! That´s the Play-in Goat!
LAL	How people can hate 39 y/o guy who still plays better than 70% of league players ... 🫠
	LeBron needs to stop stressing these haters out 😂
NOP	Zion with the Houdini impersonation.  Good work!
	Back to back great games!
LAL	He better kiss Davis rear for leading them to the win
	FT summary?
LAL	Should the Lakers intentionally give the win to NOP to face the warriors and then the Okc?
LAL	👑 finishing his 21st szn regular season game with a triple double 💪
LAL	47 wins doesn't even guarantee a playoff spot in the west
LAL	good job lakers congrats guys 💙💙💙
LAL	Congrats Lakers ❤️ GSW fan here
LAL	You can’t stop the GOAT, brilliant!!!!!
LAL	Mj I've adored Kobe Amazing but long time ago.....here comes LBj they most viewed NBA superstar i love it 💞
LAL	6x finals choker.....and a greatest chocker  of all time
	Ehgnohr Astorga wla ka alam bono
LAL	All against young squad. He ain't nothing against the clippers
LAL	❤❤❤❤
LAL	What James is achieving at his age is truly exceptional, special mention to him, he is the best player of his generation
LAL	20 at his peak thats lebron james.. but i know another basketball player who's always  at peak since his birth and that's Ali Peak from the pelepens
LAL	King Ain’t done yet! Respect the old dude. Old but Gold!
	Rechie Reignne Reigh hapdos kayu ilang kalaban pakz ug mo daug sila sa play in
	Jerffy Burmer Balite perting hapdosa gyud gong! Pero perting amia pud ana kung mapildi nila.
	Rechie Reignne Reigh lageh pd pakz noh .lethal na kayu SI Jamal mo itsa oi..confident kayu defending champ..salig TAs Goat..haha
LAL	The assists was crazy. He had 8 assists in 7 minutes. LeBron is the GOAT. Then he turned up the scoring later in the game, easily getting to 28 points 🐐
LAL	if they are on the 7th seed...denver first round...and in the next round they will face the winner of clippers and mavs
LAL	Only to face the Nuggets and get swept. Almost better losing then winning the following game
LAL	I think they can advance to the second round if they completely shut down SGA.
LAL	It seems there's a re match against Denver State Warriors soon😁
LAL	Lets see if  👑 🥔 beat the new Orleans on Tuesday or lose so they won't face the nuggets 🤷🙅
LAL	Begged so hard to create space jam 2 next he’ll wanna have a part in home alone 6… MJ laughing at this clown who can’t even pick his own jersey number
LAL	Lol everyone still thinks he's Stat padding or perhaps he could actually be trying for a playoffs push
LAL	You must highlight davis not lebronz.. Because davis is more superior player than lebronz 🤣
LAL	Secure 8th seed vs OKC🤔😆
LAL	NBA won't let NO beat LA in the play-in. LA gets in and gets swept 2 years in a row by Denver. 🔒
NOP	Pelicans will get another shot this week vs LA,But better play alot better Lakets are looking better than earlier in the season.
LAL	I'm a warriors fans but cudos Kai lebron congrats 👏👏👏
LAL	Grandpa had another triple double
	😄
NOP	🙂
LAL	#kingjames the greatest to ever do it!
LAL	MY GOAT LIST
LAL	Nice work, Refs!
LAL	Bron, what are you eating? 🤔
	Joevani Regachuelo Villanueva sopas sa mcdo
	Bandwagon is Ready....
	Jhonskie Gonzales die hard fans,, LBJ
	Ahl Gonzales mki Golden State Nuggets n muna ulet silA.ahaha
	lowkey wished the Wolves win vs Suns tonight, lol
LAL	Lebron deserves another ring at least
	Cake walk to the second round of the playoffs
	Lambordi Vince yup
LAL	17 assist and incredibly 5 steals for his age.I salute this man.respect
LAL	Lebron is having a third prime in age 39 💀
	The refs favored LeBron and the Lakers it's all fixed so LeBron gets in the playoffs and ends up in the finals
	Age doesn't match the game wth.
LAL	They absolutely need their first 5 to go big because that bench is abysmal. 16 points total??
LAL	Finally in winning mode again! Can they try Denver again? safe at 8th?
LAL	LBJ wants a rematch with NUGGETS
LAL	Wow Triple double for the last game...😊💪🏀 ☘️
LAL	With the Reffs on your side you can never lose
LAL	This man needs to retire. Somebody gotta tell him to rest and let young stars playing
	Why folks hate this gladiator called LeBron James really beats me.... somebody make me understand..
LAL	Go Lakers go!
LAL	"🤔Bruh ima say this once ""PACE"" Lakers gotta speed the game up &amp; attack the paint 💪🏾"
	They get more time this game too? Asking for a friend….
LAL	They Play again for the right to be eliminated by Denver
LAL	i think they will purposely lose to NOLA in the play-in and beat the one who will they face on no.8 seed..
NOP	Zion gonna show him up next game
LAL	Half of y’all that hate on LeBron probably never played on a team before
LAL	The True king of the 2 kingdoms(Westeros and Easteros)
LAL	LeBum catch’s fire but AD has similar stats
LAL	I guess the haters is running out of argument for The King (LeBron GOAT)
	"LeBron Raymone ""BAAAA"" JAMES 🐐👑"
LAL	The NBA is hot garbage now.
LAL	The real Laker coach has the last name James.
LAL	Winning nba ring is important.
LAL	Referees  plus  L.A lakers vs pelican
LAL	And all the haters are mad 🤣
LAL	Truth: The only stats he cant and will never  break is winning championship rings 😂😂😂
	Uhh,with what team?another NBA franchise strats to keep the team playing longer...
	Not enough win more… if not make to NBA champ this year then FIRED coach, period.
LAL	Congratz LeBron James on 11k assists well done!
	They probably cheated.
LAL	Hope AD is alright !!
LAL	Insane what this man is doing right now👑
LAL	That's great
LAL	Incredible stats for a 40 yr old phenom
LAL	LBJ ❤️
LAL	Lebum doesn't sweep .... He flops ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣

LAL	Good Game King James
	Game 1 of the Play in tournament. LAKERS lead 1-0
	Assured king
LAL	That’s at 40yrs old u Jordan lovers
LAL	Congrats
LAL	That is my man!!Love watching him play!!💙🍀🏀🙏😇🥰
LAL	Poor Davis
LAL	He still cries too much
LAL	The king of flop wins 😀😀😀
	Jordan would never at that age 🗿
LAL	Yes my king 👑💪
LAL	Le 🐐
	That’s an upset late in the season I’m shocked
LAL	Besides Kobe, James is the most powerful god
	Ref and NBA official will make sure Lakers and Lebron will enter the Semis or playofs!!!
	Mj can't do this on his age.
	ANOTHER REASON WHY HE SHOULD BE THE NEW NBA LOGO....
	How many different  hand shakes do one girl need tho
	In other words, he stopped flopping on the ground, stopped pretending like people hit him and started playing basketball. A little late to the game, Le Flop!
	Playoff - L.A. Lakers vs. Denver Nuggets?
	I guess we got a elbow each other for the top best roll actually I might be better at him in hoops cuz I can ball
LAL	LEGOAT NO MORE DEBATE HATER'S GONNA BE HATER'S FOREVER RESPECT HIS LEGACY
	"If any other player had 5 steals and 17 assist,, imagine the praise💯💯 But since it's Bron,, ""it's the play-in..""..."
LAL	The new 🐐 goat
LAL	The only time Lebron looks even close to MJ or Kobe is when he plays lottery teams 😂
	Ball out on talking to all these lovely ladies
	"Lakers will win the 2023-2034 championship and Lebron ""The GOAT"" James will be the finals MVP. 🏆🐐👑"
	And the bad boy of Pop I'm the best too
	Nuggets are Waving 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Season 21 regular season completed!!!
	Greatest Of All time
	All that just to get swept again by the nuggets
	On that note I'm swish
	Broski not ready for nuggets
	God the marketing of a has been.
LAL	Congratulation LAKERS....❤❤❤
LAL	Catches fire, to score 28 points? AD scored 30 🤣
LAL	Here we go with the bronsexuals..
LAL	The Goat💪LBJ
LAL	Who made LeBron mad 😂
LAL	Yup. Not at all rigged.
	If they can beat NO it means Denver in the 1st round.
LAL	LAKERS🏀💜💛👑🐏x👀〰️ WIN BABY #8 SEED💪yahoooo👍👌👏👏👏😀😃😄🥳
LAL	Rematch Denver vs Lakers 1st round. 😅
LAL	39 years old..triple double ..the GOAT
LAL	Give it up theNBA screwed up trying to help this disrespectful flopping queen

LAL	Triple double 🔥🔥🔥
	Lebano
	They just need to win last game so that whoever wins in gsw vs kings, they will still be 8th. Its imperative to win so that they have a chance for 7th in play in. If they lose this, the last position for them is 8th which is against jokic lol
LAL	GOAT.
LAL	They won't get past the first round.  Bunch of pretenders.
LAL	One game. Go pelicans!!!! Not because I hate Lebron but they are actually my team
LAL	I hate him. You will never get another ring. Warriors repeat !!!

LAL	Silver will make sure he goes deep in the Playoffs
LAL	Triple double for the king👑

LAL	15+ assist Triple double at age 39 is unreal.
LAL	Let me check the free-throws...
LAL	Another stressful news for all the haters. 😂🇲🇼
