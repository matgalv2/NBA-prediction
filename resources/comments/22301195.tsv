TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	All fun and games until LeBron sweeps OKC or the Timberpups in the first round 😩😭💀🤣
	another stressful day to lbj haters 🤣🤣🤣
	He completely shut Zion down on the defensive end, too. Just an insane performance after this many seasons/minutes.
	I think it's safe to say that the GOAT debate is over.
	The GOAT, no doubt.
	Another stressful news for all the haters. 🥴
	Rematch Denver vs Lakers 1st round. 😅
	Great win, let's carry that momentum into finals!!
	They just need to win last game so that whoever wins in gsw vs kings, they will still be 8th. Its imperative to win so that they have a chance for 7th in play in. If they lose this, the last position for them is 8th which is against jokic lol
	The goat all the way
	Lebron is the GOAT at the age of 39!!
	37yrs. I'm always gonna put mj upfront. But LBJ longevity and hes trying to conserve his burst at certain points in the game is brady like.my bad I'm writing drunk
	Great game by  . Hoping to duplicate it for the 7th seed and a rematch with Nuggets
	It’s something bout that 3rd q lakers don’t like lol almost every game they slow down in the 3rd but good win
	King LBJ  is the Greatest player to ever play basketball👑😎
	Funny how we go hard in this kind of game but sir vs Boston, Clipper etc. stay grabbin to the fullest. Do this in the playoffs.
	The lakers are putting on a good run last few games, gotta respect the effort &amp; grit bron still has it in him aft all these years.
	Almost 40 still playing this way probably will never be seen again. As a true basketball I will not take this for granted.
	The NBA is so rigged for LBJ. It is so blatantly obvious.
	It must be hard for someone to hate another person for the entire 21 years with no signs of stopping any time soon..
	If the Lakers can Beat that Nuggets in the 1st round... Lakers will have a chance to get the Championship🏆🏀🫡
	Say what you want, but today LeBron wanted this win and earned it
	what a performance at age 39, 21 years in the league and of course haters will always find a way to bash this dude..a tripple double and a win😬 such a ridiculous player🤦
	LeBron, lol. He sat out a game for load management, meantime, if he played one more game this season he would have made another record, most missed field goals in NBA history
	Appreciate greatness LBJ
	Wow lbj grabi age 39 still amazing dunk still dominant still prime still MVP still best ever the superhumangoat 🌟
	We are winning this tournament also 👏 🙌🏾
	And @ 39yrs of age, LBJ is amazing in his 21st season.
	Congrats lakers and LBJ 👏💪
	wow big size playmaker  17 assist
	Los Angeles Lakers Vs New Orleans Pelicans
	Thunder vs. Lakers in the 1st Round
	 ...GOAT.....age is a number..❤️🥰
	Lakers win ❤️
	9 ast in 1st quarter .  😁😁
	Triple double..what a nice game💪💪💪
	Lakers 2024 nba champions
	That’s why he’s the GOAT! 17 assists and 28 points on very efficient shooting. Don’t think another player wearing No 23 ever did that. I dare say it again! Before his career is over he’ll be the number one scorer All-Time and at least Number 3 in <a tabindex=🫶👏👌❤️ Hail to the King!
	This is the reason why LeBron will always be light years better than Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan would be Philippine Basketball Association import level without Rodman and Pippen’s help and Phil Jackson’s coaching.
	Rookie of the year candidate
	All haters to the podium
	What a monster performance. Imagine lolobron  28 pts with 17 assist he like 25yrs old..
	The game became soft..what do you expect
	Pwenersa n Lolo 😃😃
	Greatest Player of all time
	That's why he is the Goat 🐐
	I didn't know Lebron already has 3 peat. 🤣🤣🤣
	I can't imagine the face of the haters now, that they've been hating for the past 21 seasons😫😱😭🤣
	No bearing game..The play-off picture is already settled..The Pelicans already secured their place in the playoffs so why risk 'injury' to their 'stars'..Part of the game..
	Lakers vs Nuggets 1st round will be great.
	Stop that debate we dont have benifits whoever becomes great player for they are only playing for money and fame..  they play because they are paid..
	Please lose vs the pelicans lakers ! Would much rather play OKC in the first round than Denver
	LBJ is really awesome bball player n team L.A. Lakers win against Pelican.!!!
	Great points, assist, reb,&amp; still,👑💪👌
	As I said before, Pelicans has no place beating experienced teams. The same thing could be said for Thunder and T-Wolves. I hope I'm wrong
	"It's funny how a ""lesser"" player like Austin Reaves finishes his work season playing all 82 games. While the supposed Mr. Longevity and Mr. Records barely has any full seasons in his long career. No, don't argue his age now. He had plenty times to do it in his prime but didn't like a diva. Lakers' own ""Iron Man"" AC Green would put him to shame."
	LBJ 21 years...3 time sweep...
	I wonder how much the refs help them fr lol now all the media gonna say they gonna win it all right lol
	Alright!! Let's go !! 'bron 💪💪 Lakers win 💪💪
	game was almost unwatchable, poor coaching from wilie green , Bron with AD pick and roll is to complicated for him as coach.. Austin Reaves look like Larry Bird against McCullum and Chose  😃
	Good for LeBron he's pretty good for a grandpa. ❤️
	Whether you are a fan or a hater, his professional attitude is an inspiration. 👑
	only magic could play pg like this, not leave out my beast Westbrook but he doesnt have the size
	Congratulations Lakers 💜💛💪
	Lakers need to lose in the 1st play in game then win for the 8th seed so they don't meet the nuggets right away. It's their kryptonite.
	"No, the referees handed LeBron James the ball at the foul line. Stop trying to make this a story that it wasn't. The referees gave the Lakers twice as many foul shots as the Pelicans and they won by less than that. The better team the entire game was t… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	I do like that Bosley hair for men, has supported LeFlop and sponsors him
	No one can great this basketball player ever the KING👑👑 GOAT.
	Nice with the tripple-double, but let's not quickly forget that AD frontlined Laker's team with that 30 PTS. Man's been on fire, a great hooper. But LBJ is goat, that can't be argued. Still racking up the stats at 39.
	all of this will come. To an end as they face the Kryptonite The Joker and Playoff mode Jamal Murray.
	Good luck 🍀👍🏼
	Those stats are crazy and the defense the stats don't show 🔥
	Sad thing is, CJ is the NBA Players President,  far more respected than LeTrade, but never get recognition. I suppose if you don't bring in superstars (cough cough Davis) it is sort of unimaginable to be seen. 49 wins over 47 with Not a single AllStar ... yikes LA
	Lebron is the true goat and king!! This season he is breaking records every time he steps in the court. I am enjoying every minute of this historical run.
	Still hasn’t 3peated twice yet
	Year 21
	4swept in the nba history and king of flopping king of turnover also king of airball..yahahahahaha
	Congrats Lakers I how A,D, is going to be ok,👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️🏀
	of course. He sat out so he could rest as he does prior to the playoffs while others had to play
	Even your not the goat, but you are the king.... Better scoring, assisst, rebound, and chase block than the goat,. That epic 3-1 comeback against the best record in nba in championship. The kings team defeated the  team that has the best record in nba, while the goat team is the second best record in nba,
	My GOAT King James,  congrats lakers.
	An entire game of sick dimes.
	I love the 😄 reactions
	I wish sports comments were only limited to USA citizens 🙄
	Scores are this high because no one plays Defense, the NBA is not good basketball , it’s a joke league
	You guys Need to Respect LeBron James ..💯🔥💯,. ... it's just that Simple.. very simple..
	7 assists in the 1st 4 minutes of the game!! He's so good it's insane!!
	Well games, but davis seen like injury...
	A road game, what else the haters can say?
	I think Lebron is the GOAT.
	Gifted player ...ever...the king 👑 James
	Outstanding performance for a guy who leads a Play-in team!! That´s the Play-in Goat!
	How people can hate 39 y/o guy who still plays better than 70% of league players ... 🫠
	LeBron needs to stop stressing these haters out 😂
	Zion with the Houdini impersonation.  Good work!
	Back to back great games!
	He better kiss Davis rear for leading them to the win
	FT summary?
	Should the Lakers intentionally give the win to NOP to face the warriors and then the Okc?
	👑 finishing his 21st szn regular season game with a triple double 💪
	47 wins doesn't even guarantee a playoff spot in the west
	good job lakers congrats guys 💙💙💙
	Congrats Lakers ❤️ GSW fan here
	You can’t stop the GOAT, brilliant!!!!!
	Mj I've adored Kobe Amazing but long time ago.....here comes LBj they most viewed NBA superstar i love it 💞
	6x finals choker.....and a greatest chocker  of all time
	 wla ka alam bono
	All against young squad. He ain't nothing against the clippers
	❤❤❤❤
	What James is achieving at his age is truly exceptional, special mention to him, he is the best player of his generation
	20 at his peak thats lebron james.. but i know another basketball player who's always  at peak since his birth and that's Ali Peak from the pelepens
	King Ain’t done yet! Respect the old dude. Old but Gold!
	The assists was crazy. He had 8 assists in 7 minutes. LeBron is the GOAT. Then he turned up the scoring later in the game, easily getting to 28 points 🐐
	if they are on the 7th seed...denver first round...and in the next round they will face the winner of clippers and mavs
	Only to face the Nuggets and get swept. Almost better losing then winning the following game
	I think they can advance to the second round if they completely shut down SGA.
	It seems there's a re match against Denver State Warriors soon😁
	Lets see if  👑 🥔 beat the new Orleans on Tuesday or lose so they won't face the nuggets 🤷🙅
	Begged so hard to create space jam 2 next he’ll wanna have a part in home alone 6… MJ laughing at this clown who can’t even pick his own jersey number
	Lol everyone still thinks he's Stat padding or perhaps he could actually be trying for a playoffs push
	You must highlight davis not lebronz.. Because davis is more superior player than lebronz 🤣
	Secure 8th seed vs OKC🤔😆
	NBA won't let NO beat LA in the play-in. LA gets in and gets swept 2 years in a row by Denver. 🔒
	Pelicans will get another shot this week vs LA,But better play alot better Lakets are looking better than earlier in the season.
	I'm a warriors fans but cudos Kai lebron congrats 👏👏👏
	Grandpa had another triple double 
	 the greatest to ever do it!
	MY GOAT LIST
	Nice work, Refs!
	Bron, what are you eating? 🤔
	 sopas sa mcdo
	Bandwagon is Ready....
	 die hard fans,, LBJ
	lowkey wished the Wolves win vs Suns tonight, lol
	Lebron deserves another ring at least
	Cake walk to the second round of the playoffs
	17 assist and incredibly 5 steals for his age.I salute this man.respect
	Lebron is having a third prime in age 39 💀
	The refs favored LeBron and the Lakers it's all fixed so LeBron gets in the playoffs and ends up in the finals
	Age doesn't match the game wth.
	They absolutely need their first 5 to go big because that bench is abysmal. 16 points total??
	Finally in winning mode again! Can they try Denver again? safe at 8th?
	LBJ wants a rematch with NUGGETS
	Wow Triple double for the last game...😊💪🏀 ☘️
	With the Reffs on your side you can never lose
	This man needs to retire. Somebody gotta tell him to rest and let young stars playing
	Why folks hate this gladiator called LeBron James really beats me.... somebody make me understand..
	Go Lakers go!
	🤔Bruh ima say this once 
	They get more time this game too? Asking for a friend….
	They Play again for the right to be eliminated by Denver
	i think they will purposely lose to NOLA in the play-in and beat the one who will they face on no.8 seed..
	Zion gonna show him up next game
	Half of y’all that hate on LeBron probably never played on a team before
	The True king of the 2 kingdoms(Westeros and Easteros)
	LeBum catch’s fire but AD has similar stats
	I guess the haters is running out of argument for The King (LeBron GOAT) 
	LeBron Raymone 👑
	The NBA is hot garbage now.
	The real Laker coach has the last name James.
	Winning nba ring is important.
	Referees  plus  L.A lakers vs pelican
	And all the haters are mad 🤣
	Truth: The only stats he cant and will never  break is winning championship rings 😂😂😂
	Uhh,with what team?another NBA franchise strats to keep the team playing longer...
	Not enough win more… if not make to NBA champ this year then FIRED coach, period.
	Congratz  on 11k assists well done!
	They probably cheated.
	Hope AD is alright !!
	Insane what this man is doing right now👑
	That's great
	Incredible stats for a 40 yr old phenom
	LBJ ❤️
	Lebum doesn't sweep .... He flops ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	I fw both teams the pelicans was down by 32 and didn’t give up
	LeBron Haters

	"This is a 39 y.o. LeBron James that we're talking about. People are wearing that laughing emoji out in these comments. Let's just doing a ""hater"" count while we're at it."

	LebrooooonJameees❤️👑
	Good Game King James
	Game 1 of the Play in tournament. LAKERS lead 1-0
	Assured king
	That’s at 40yrs old u Jordan lovers
	Congrats
	That is my man!!Love watching him play!!💙🍀🏀🙏😇🥰
	Poor Davis
	He still cries too much
	The king of flop wins 😀😀😀
	Jordan would never at that age 🗿
	Yes my king 👑💪
	Le 🐐
	That’s an upset late in the season I’m shocked
	Besides Kobe, James is the most powerful god
	Ref and NBA official will make sure Lakers and Lebron will enter the Semis or playofs!!!
	Mj can't do this on his age.
	ANOTHER REASON WHY HE SHOULD BE THE NEW NBA LOGO....
	How many different  hand shakes do one girl need tho
	In other words, he stopped flopping on the ground, stopped pretending like people hit him and started playing basketball. A little late to the game, Le Flop!
	Playoff - L.A. Lakers vs. Denver Nuggets?
	I guess we got a elbow each other for the top best roll actually I might be better at him in hoops cuz I can ball
	LEGOAT NO MORE DEBATE HATER'S GONNA BE HATER'S FOREVER RESPECT HIS LEGACY
	"If any other player had 5 steals and 17 assist,, imagine the praise💯💯 But since it's Bron,, ""it's the play-in..""..."
	The new 🐐 goat
	The only time Lebron looks even close to MJ or Kobe is when he plays lottery teams 😂
	Ball out on talking to all these lovely ladies
	Lakers will win the 2023-2034 championship and Lebron 🐐👑
	And the bad boy of Pop I'm the best too
	Nuggets are Waving 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Season 21 regular season completed!!!
	Greatest Of All time
	All that just to get swept again by the nuggets
	On that note I'm swish
	Broski not ready for nuggets
	God the marketing of a has been.
	Congratulation LAKERS....❤❤❤
	Catches fire, to score 28 points? AD scored 30 🤣
	Here we go with the bronsexuals..
	The Goat💪LBJ
	Who made LeBron mad 😂
	Yup. Not at all rigged.
	If they can beat NO it means Denver in the 1st round.
	LAKERS🏀💜💛👑🐏x👀〰️ WIN BABY #8 SEED💪yahoooo👍👌👏👏👏😀😃😄🥳
	Rematch Denver vs Lakers 1st round. 😅

	Nice win Lakers! 💜💛💪 Lezgo play-in game
	He's FORTY! 
	Let's see how the 1st round goes we all seen this episode Jordan would have never let it happen 2 times let alone back to back that's going to be a bad year on the resume
	Triple double 🔥🔥🔥
	Lebano
	They just need to win last game so that whoever wins in gsw vs kings, they will still be 8th. Its imperative to win so that they have a chance for 7th in play in. If they lose this, the last position for them is 8th which is against jokic lol
	GOAT.
	They won't get past the first round.  Bunch of pretenders.
	One game. Go pelicans!!!! Not because I hate Lebron but they are actually my team
	I hate him. You will never get another ring. Warriors repeat !!!
	We all know he do all this can he have heart to win with out 15 stars with him
	Keep wining so you face Denver!!!
	Silver will make sure he goes deep in the Playoffs
	Triple double for the king👑
	The Greatest to ever play the game!! Long live the King
	15+ assist Triple double at age 39 is unreal.
	Let me check the free-throws...
	Another stressful news for all the haters. 😂🇲🇼
	It favors floppers
	GOAT debate been over for years. Only ones left saying Jordan are old heads and YouTube jock sniffers
	don't forget the 4 turnovers...also the  Most turnovers in NBA history 5000+ for his career. No GOAT....
