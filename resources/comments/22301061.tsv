TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Yeah we are getting 1st rounded again. Our team is in shambles. Trading Jrue will be our downfall.
	 The same Jrue who got cooked by Jimmy?
	 The same Jimmy that cooked by Joker?
	 Nikola cooked Bam, actually.
	Bucks fans on here whining but they need to take a look at the Pelicans record. They are not scrubs. In the east they would be a solid 3 seed and only a game back of Milwaukee.
	 facts I'm sure they didn't check the pelicans record
	Put some respect on Herbert Jones, he had some crazy shot blocks💪🏽
	
	Pels are actually scary as of late. I think they’re gonna surprise a lot of people in the playoffs
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs New Orleans Pelicans
	Y all laughed and here we are Geaux  Pels
	Oredroc Soled Seyer Ednylehem you were cheering for the lakers last week now you're acting like you've been a pels fan ahahahha casual lol also seeet copy and paste from a real pelicans fan lol you're embarrassing yourself
	It just didn't even look like the bucks playing they missed everything 🤔
	Finals matchup would be glorious.
	Jeez pelicans doing better than I thought 💪💪
	 rehefa tsy eo bota dia eo zokibe McCollum 😅
	Go Pelicans
	CJ was off the hook
	Let's Go Rockets!
	1st round exit
	Narrow win

	CJ respect man
	What A Win For The Pelicans
	Le match final serait glorieux❣️
	doc rivers effect
	Another strong win 💪🏾
	Doesn't seem like the Bucks will go far in playoffs even with Liliard.
	Y'all wanted Doc Rivers. Now except the losing.
	Pels are playing well even without BI. They are going to be scary if they're healthy in the playoffs!
	See what a healthy Zion can do... And his team mates
	Bucks are
	CJ AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAMATE
	Pels are the biggest dark horse in the playoffs this year.

	Bucks should trade for this man instead of Dame.They were like Brown and Tatum in Portland,Dame and CJ before.
	bucks is on a self destruction, they aint going in finals hahahaha
	Bucks ain’t winning no championship this year
	I’m legitimately paying out “5” grands to the first “6” people to message me with “FAITH” cus I feel some people going through difficulties this year, y’all stay blessed.
	Knicks are coming for that # 2 seed. Bucks = pretenders not contenders.
	 Considering the Bucks have already won the season series with the Knicks, I’m simply not sure about that.

	They lost jrue holiday big time.🤦🏽
	Mccollum can go f himself
	Doc is the one needs medical attention for choking syndrome
	Game 🎮 🤡
	The bucks will fall to the 3th seed soon, how do you let a team shot under 40% from the field beat you? Pathetic
	Things are kinda tough at especially this time of the year so I'm gifting 5 grands to the first 10 people to message me with
