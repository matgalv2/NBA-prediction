TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
MIL	Yeah we are getting 1st rounded again. Our team is in shambles. Trading Jrue will be our downfall.
MIL	Brandon Rice The same Jrue who got cooked by Jimmy?
	Tragic Hero The same Jimmy that cooked by Joker?
	Brandon Rice Nikola cooked Bam, actually.
MIL	Bucks fans on here whining but they need to take a look at the Pelicans record. They are not scrubs. In the east they would be a solid 3 seed and only a game back of Milwaukee.
	Christopher Eli facts I'm sure they didn't check the pelicans record
NOP	Put some respect on Herbert Jones, he had some crazy shot blocks💪🏽
	Oli Sturgess
NOP	Pels are actually scary as of late. I think they’re gonna surprise a lot of people in the playoffs

MIL	doc rivers effect
MIL	Doesn't seem like the Bucks will go far in playoffs even with Liliard.
MIL	Y'all wanted Doc Rivers. Now except the losing.

MIL	bucks is on a self destruction, they aint going in finals hahahaha
MIL	Bucks ain’t winning no championship this year
	I’m legitimately paying out “5” grands to the first “6” people to message me with “FAITH” cus I feel some people going through difficulties this year, y’all stay blessed.
MIL	Knicks are coming for that # 2 seed. Bucks = pretenders not contenders.
MIL	Michael William Cassidy Considering the Bucks have already won the season series with the Knicks, I’m simply not sure about that.
	The world is rotten and people don't mind, we aren´t here to enjoy or have fun, this life is a proof. It´s incredible, no matter how difficult the situation gets, almost no one wants to obey GOD - JESUS CHRIST and TRULY do his will (far away from relig… Wyświetl więcej
