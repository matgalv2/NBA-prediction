TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Yeah we are getting 1st rounded again. Our team is in shambles. Trading Jrue will be our downfall.
	Brandon Rice The same Jrue who got cooked by Jimmy?
	Tragic Hero The same Jimmy that cooked by Joker?
	Brandon Rice Nikola cooked Bam, actually.
	Bucks fans on here whining but they need to take a look at the Pelicans record. They are not scrubs. In the east they would be a solid 3 seed and only a game back of Milwaukee.
	Christopher Eli facts I'm sure they didn't check the pelicans record
	Put some respect on Herbert Jones, he had some crazy shot blocks💪🏽
	Oli Sturgess
	Pels are actually scary as of late. I think they’re gonna surprise a lot of people in the playoffs
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs New Orleans Pelicans
	Y all laughed and here we are Geaux  Pels
	Oredroc Soled Seyer Ednylehem you were cheering for the lakers last week now you're acting like you've been a pels fan ahahahha casual lol also seeet copy and paste from a real pelicans fan lol you're embarrassing yourself
	It just didn't even look like the bucks playing they missed everything 🤔
	Finals matchup would be glorious.

	CJ was off the hook
	1st round exit

	What A Win For The Pelicans
	Le match final serait glorieux❣️

	doc rivers effect
	Doesn't seem like the Bucks will go far in playoffs even with Liliard.
	Y'all wanted Doc Rivers. Now except the losing.
	Pels are playing well even without BI. They are going to be scary if they're healthy in the playoffs!
	See what a healthy Zion can do... And his team mates
	Bucks are
	CJ AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAMATE
	Pels are the biggest dark horse in the playoffs this year.

	Bucks should trade for this man instead of Dame.They were like Brown and Tatum in Portland,Dame and CJ before.
	bucks is on a self destruction, they aint going in finals hahahaha
	Bucks ain’t winning no championship this year
	I’m legitimately paying out “5” grands to the first “6” people to message me with “FAITH” cus I feel some people going through difficulties this year, y’all stay blessed.
	Knicks are coming for that # 2 seed. Bucks = pretenders not contenders.
	Michael William Cassidy Considering the Bucks have already won the season series with the Knicks, I’m simply not sure about that.
	The world is rotten and people don't mind, we aren´t here to enjoy or have fun, this life is a proof. It´s incredible, no matter how difficult the situation gets, almost no one wants to obey GOD - JESUS CHRIST and TRULY do his will (far away from relig… Wyświetl więcej

	The bucks will fall to the 3th seed soon, how do you let a team shot under 40% from the field beat you? Pathetic
