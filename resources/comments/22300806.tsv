	Danielson Culaniban: Suns suffered succesive back to back defeats by two Texas teams, if I remember correctly the other Texas team also beat Suns. I stand for correction.
	The Suns need to change something
	great to see harden trim his beard
	Houston won't make the top 10, West is on fire
	Dakamela Artford Xolani looks like it but im still hopeful. 🙂
	Lakers and Warriors are pushing to be in as well, improving as well, so chances are very slim, even though they started well the season, but they've dropped recently
	KD going back to OKC after this!!!🤦🏽‍♂️😭
