	The Bulls absolutely became a much better team without LaVine
	At this point, they should just replace Wizards with the best G League team. I bet they can do a better job
	 that’s not a bad idea it would be like soccer where the worst teams get relegated to the lower leagues and the best ones move up….only if the league really wants to crackdown on tanking
	 exactly. Imagine bottom teams playing for their lives to not finish last and get relegated. It would make it fun to watch.
	Wow ayo! Too good
	Never heard of the guy, but good game
	A PREVIEW OF THE 2200 ECF 👀👀👀
	Ayo is 🔥! Him and Coby have improved so much
	Ayo, highest character player you'll ever find. Love the way his family supported him at Illinois and came to every single game.
	every win is worth its weight in gold now, it's great, we have a beautiful match with a win. Bravo Ayo, 34 points, wow, congratulations 👌✌👏👏🏀🏀🏀❤
	He put in the work for years now its all coming. Together.
	He's a solid player since then he can make offense needed for the bulls squad
	Ayo Dosunmu hits 34 points
	Wizards are championship bound!!!!
	Way to go Ayo! Go Bulls!
	Ayo padded his stats against a CRAP team. Let's get some consistency please!!!!
	 How many did you score? Yeah, thats what I thought...
	 I'm not the one getting paid millions to ball... I'm just one of the millions helping this guy earn his paycheck by being a supporter of the team. See how that works?
	It's a wonderful game.
	
	He and Coby White are the Future of the Bulls Backcourt   .
	Congratulations Ayo. Continue to do what you do.❤️🏀
	He’s the best!
	Way to go Ayo💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
	Congratulations 🎉
	
	I just realized that’s the Washington Monument on the logo…. And, whatever you do, do NOT flip the Bulls logo upside down…🦀🙈.
	THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS SUCKS, THEY ARE THE WORST TEAM IN THE NBA..........
	Let the young talent play?
	Ayo Dosunmu
