TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The Bulls absolutely became a much better team without LaVine
	Keith Sison kind of better team. I like moving on from Zach, But they need Coby White back. And new ownership 
	Keith Sison then why are we still under 500?  I think you meant to say Coby and ayo get more touches points and more playing time with him out
	Keith Sison Don’t forget Patrick Williams. He should never have been the #4 pick in that draft class.
	At this point, they should just replace Wizards with the best G League team. I bet they can do a better job
	David Lara Jr. that’s not a bad idea it would be like soccer where the worst teams get relegated to the lower leagues and the best ones move up….only if the league really wants to crackdown on tanking
	Brock Crowley exactly. Imagine bottom teams playing for their lives to not finish last and get relegated. It would make it fun to watch.
	David Lara Jr. but Charles Barkley says we’re not capable of winning the college tourney. Yet we pound bottom seed teams and win by 20 plus points 
	Wow ayo! Too good
	Never heard of the guy, but good game
	A PREVIEW OF THE 2200 ECF 👀👀👀
	I knew he would go crazy sense Illinois win today !
	Derrick Mikey hello Derrick
	Ayo is 🔥! Him and Coby have improved so much
	Jeff Gerard hello Jeff
	Ayo, highest character player you'll ever find. Love the way his family supported him at Illinois and came to every single game.
	Mike Rubenstein that is a fact
	every win is worth its weight in gold now, it's great, we have a beautiful match with a win. Bravo Ayo, 34 points, wow, congratulations 👌✌👏👏🏀🏀🏀❤
	He put in the work for years now its all coming. Together.
	Most  improved player
	He's a solid player since then he can make offense needed for the bulls squad
	Ayo Dosunmu hits 34 points
	Two Illini players had career games yesterday
	Ayo padded his stats against a CRAP team. Let's get some consistency please!!!!
	Le'Mark A Russell How many did you score? Yeah, thats what I thought...
	Brian Priester I'm not the one getting paid millions to ball... I'm just one of the millions helping this guy earn his paycheck by being a supporter of the team. See how that works?
	Way to go Ayo! Go Bulls!
	Wizards are championship bound!!!!
	Still need a new coach
	Ayo está fazendo uma ótima temporada
	It's a wonderful game.

	Congratulations Ayo. Continue to do what you do.❤️🏀
	He and Coby White are the Future of the Bulls Backcourt #SEERED #BullsNation #RunWithUs.

	I just realized that’s the Washington Monument on the logo…. And, whatever you do, do NOT flip the Bulls logo upside down…🦀🙈.
	THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS SUCKS, THEY ARE THE WORST TEAM IN THE NBA..........
