PHX	Come on, only 5 rebounds in an entire game! The sun is setting on your career, Durant! It’s a pity that the team carries the name Suns instead of Sons, considering that only one sun hangs in our galaxy, just like 1 moon on Earth!
PHX	KD is real GOAT ever. He always lead games to win. Big scorer ever.
PHX	It wasn’t pretty but a win is a win!  Go Suns!!
