TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Great Performances from Suns 👏👏
	Anyone who actually watched the game last night knows it was Beal who led the charge, period! END of of discussion
	Yusef Taufiq It’s a team sport.
	Ian Wilson correct sir, but Beal carried us at the towards the 3rd till the end of the game. He played out of his mind, even his teammates acknowledged this, it's not hard to know this if you watched the game
	It was a great game!
	An yes. The playin team
	😂
	😂
	Thank you suns,, Lakers fans here, lol
	You obvi didn’t watch the game, Bradley Beal got us this win !!!!
	Bradley Beal led the way
	Yes, great players, can be done working together...... Yeego! Yeego! Yeego!
	Come on, only 5 rebounds in an entire game! The sun is setting on your career, Durant! It’s a pity that the team carries the name Suns instead of Sons, considering that only one sun hangs in our galaxy, just like 1 moon on Earth!
	KD is real GOAT ever. He always lead games to win. Big scorer ever.
	It wasn’t pretty but a win is a win!  Go Suns!!
	Exellcent Win Suns
	Which means it will be GSW vs. Sacramento for the play in?
	I don’t care who lead a win is a win
	Kevin Durant
	In scoring maybe but Beal was the star player last night
	Phoenix Suns Vs Sacramento Kings
	Keep up that momentum Suns!!
	nurkic free throw won that game lol but credit to beal!
	Kevin Durant leads the way for Suns
	I was at the game.  Gritty, sloppy but they hung in there

	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Manando Atm Cebza
	Was a horrible game and they just got lucky. They didn't deserve the win at all
