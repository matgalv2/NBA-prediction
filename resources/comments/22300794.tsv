	🧡💙
	🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
	Buckets Bogdonovic and Precious Achiuwa were both mid season trades and they’ve been playing great for us. Especially Precious. That kid is absolutely dominating everyone he plays against.
	Clown on Joel all you'll want, but Philly is absolutely a lottery team without him. They are 2 games from the Play-In, while they were easily the 2nd or 3rd seed with him. Put sum Cot-Damn respek on his name.
	Sekou Garrett of course. If he played they would’ve won because the refs would have sent him to the line to shoot 24 times because any time you get close to the guy the whistle blows 🤣
	I forgot Bogie is in New York now
	Bojan Bogdanovic
	Great pickup
	Triple B is on fire.....
	That bugger Joel is still out?
	Badass
