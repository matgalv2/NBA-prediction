TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	First round exit 😅🤪
	 I’m saving this comment keep this same energy!
	 sure 😁
	 how's davis feeling? He's your only hope to even make the playoffs 😆 🤣 😂
	 you wish
	Easy win for LA/GSW
	Who’s number one doesn’t even matter. There is no team that has 4 wins over the Denver Nuggets in their tank. Not even the Celtics.
	Good job
	I still don't take Minnesota seriously what seed they end up that team is gonna give them problems in The First Round
	 the only lower seeded team that would give them a series is the Lakers.  Everyone else is going to get swept by the Wolves.  They are easily the best defense in the NBA and defense carries well into the playoffs.
	 I agree with you Jared
	Top 3 defender all time!
	He likes to choke in the playoffs
	Wait .... what? Two team number 1 in West conference 😁
	Hahahaha trying his best to beat his fellow countrymen. 😂😂😂
	NBA says wolves are #1 even though they aren’t right now
	Lakers gonna take em out 😩
	Minnesota is #1 in the west for now.
	4x DPOY incoming 🔥🔥🔥
	Thought that put OKC at #1...  Update.  It did
	Wolves gonna make some noise in the playoffs would not be surprised if they get swept by the Celtics in the finals
	Imagine. LeBron and AD managed to get back 7th seed, for them to face the Nuggets 😂
	Let's see if Gobert can do this consistently in the playoffs
	Happy for the wolves but they're definitely a target for the play-in teams
	1st round exit nice
	He actually did something for once. Congrats
	" if you only you watch games instead of repeating fake news from bleacher report and having fun of 1 poster against him per month. Going for a 4th DPOY and making this team 1st in defense while being on top says a lot. Please Giannis is … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 you don’t watch the wolves huh…he’s arguably their MVP this year for the team
	 I’m convinced some people only read stats &amp; watch highlights cuz Gobert really is their backbone. Truly a phenomenal player, 💪🏼 he is so mentally &amp; physically involved each game.
	" I do. The dude can’t even make wide open layups with his height and wingspan let alone 2 freethrows in a row. At least giannis worked on his game and added muscle. This dude has been maybe 1 dimensional for his entire career. And he’s… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 I’ve watched every game this year and I can tell by you saying that, that you’ve maybe seen a couple games..
	 This guy just sounds like a hater. Yes we need work in our offense but our players coexist in the game the #1 spot in defense in the nba speaks for that. 💚💙
	I still have no idea if the Wolves control their destiny for the one seed or not.
	OKC in number 1 in the west lol.
	Wemby does this every game
	Okc is number #1 at the moment. The tie breakers are very confusing though lol.
	OKC is 1
	Wolves have a better conference record.
	OKC is in 1st
	Rudy is the guy wolves were looking for
	Tie breaker, mods. Figure it out.
	and you guys should be thanking the Spurs for keeping denver out #1
	😀
	 🤷🏿‍♀️
	Face Lakers and a first round exit
	Cant wait to be hurt again! LET'S GO WOLVES! 😍 
	5 blocks that cute 🥰
	 it's not, and never has been, about total blocks. It's about the shots you change and the people you NOPE out of shooting and then also blocks. Gobert is the easy DPOY winner
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
	‘Cough cough’ Check again….. ⚡️⚡️
	OKC is in 1st in the Western Conference
	As Kendrick Perkins would call him “Rudy GoBurr”
	Every Filipenis in the comments: 
	Where the Gobert haters at?
	They are number two actually behind the thunder. Three way tie that will be broken by Sunday.
	Rudy Rudy Double Doublert 🏀
	Thanks to Wemby you mean
	we would've been first still if we don't blow the lead at the last second
	Was a good 20minutes. They're 2nd again
	
	OKC is #1 atm
	Rudy Gobert
	Awesome
	First round playoff exit
	Thanks to the spurs
	ANT MVP
	The Goblin💪
	Rudy Gorbet got it
