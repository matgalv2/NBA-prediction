TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Easy win for LA/GSW
	First round exit 😅🤪
	La Cey I’m saving this comment keep this same energy!
	😁
	La Cey how's davis feeling? He's your only hope to even make the playoffs  🤣 😂
	La Cey you wish
	Who’s number one doesn’t even matter. There is no team that has 4 wins over the Denver Nuggets in their tank. Not even the Celtics.
	Good job
	Top 3 defender all time!
	I still don't take Minnesota seriously what seed they end up that team is gonna give them problems in The First Round
	Jeremy James the only lower seeded team that would give them a series is the Lakers.  Everyone else is going to get swept by the Wolves.  They are easily the best defense in the NBA and defense carries well into the playoffs.
	Jared Matthew I agree with you Jared
	Wait .... what? Two team number 1 in West conference 😁
	He likes to choke in the playoffs
	Peter Crawford ok sure
	Peter Crawford if only you know bball
	Hahahaha trying his best to beat his fellow countrymen. 😂😂😂
	Minnesota is #1 in the west for now.
	4x DPOY incoming 🔥🔥🔥
	NBA says wolves are #1 even though they aren’t right now
	Thought that put OKC at #1...  Update.  It did
	Maxwell Sinard, no. Minnesota holds the tie breaker over OKC. Minnesota is in 1st.
	Kimberly Sue yeah it goes to head to head not division wins.  OKC is in first
	Maxwell Sinard, yah, I saw someone else say that too. Absolutely crazy how this is playing out.
	Kimberly Sue meh.  We had our chance wednesday
	Maxwell Sinard, we did but the 3 way tie thing is kinda crazy.
	Marcus Nordstrom no.  If all 3 then 3 way tiebreaker.  So OKC 5-3, wolves 4-4 it's online.  I just can't share the pic
	Lakers gonna take em out 😩
	Anthony Lopez the Lakers are not a good road team and they win at home courtesy of the ridiculous amount of FTs they get.
	Jason Eric Jodoin you don’t think that FTA average gonna be high all series, I’m not a Lakers fan, but the NBA wants them in it
	Imagine. LeBron and AD managed to get back 7th seed, for them to face the Nuggets 😂
	Let's see if Gobert can do this consistently in the playoffs
	Happy for the wolves but they're definitely a target for the play-in teams
	Wemby does this every game
	1st round exit nice
	Okc is number #1 at the moment. The tie breakers are very confusing though lol.
	OKC in number 1 in the west lol.
	I still have no idea if the Wolves control their destiny for the one seed or not.
	Wolves have a better conference record.
	OKC is 1
	He actually did something for once. Congrats
	Tanner Paradiso if you only you watch games instead of repeating fake news from bleacher report and having fun of 1 poster against him per month. Going for a 4th DPOY and making this team 1st in defense while being on top says a lot. Please Giannis is great and love the guy and he's surrounded by an amazing squad and are not close to be as dangerous as the Wolves trying to get a grip with an unsuccessful change of coach...
	Francis Gagné yup I watch games buddy but Idgaf about watching the wolves. Anytime you see Gobert play. Dude shouldn’t be in the conversations y’all put him in. So stop with the glazing
	Tanner Paradiso you don’t watch the wolves huh…he’s arguably their MVP this year for the team
	💪🏼 he is so mentally &amp; physically involved each game.
	Kevin M. McDonald I do. The dude can’t even make wide open layups with his height and wingspan let alone 2 freethrows in a row. At least giannis worked on his game and added muscle. This dude has been maybe 1 dimensional for his entire career. And he’s… Wyświetl więcej
	Tanner Paradiso I’ve watched every game this year and I can tell by you saying that, that you’ve maybe seen a couple games..
	💚💙
	Rudy is the guy wolves were looking for
	OKC is in 1st
	Tie breaker, mods. Figure it out.
	Brandon Guerra Minnesota has the tie breaker, right?
	Kimberly Sue not if it’s a three-way tie. Yes they have head to head tie-breaker with both OKC and Denver but only if it’s just one of those. If they are tied with both then OKC has the tiebreaker with MIN 2nd
	Kimberly Sue no they don’t.. Thunder are 5-3 against Den &amp; Min therefore holding the tie breaker. Don’t be stupid and comment.
	Kenneth McDaniel, got it. Thanks. Someone explained it after I commented. So, then OKC, if they win Sunday will be 1st and Dallas has all their players out.
	and you guys should be thanking the Spurs for keeping denver out #1
	😀
	🤷🏿‍♀️
	Face Lakers and a first round exit
	OKC is #1 atm
	Cant wait to be hurt again! LET'S GO WOLVES! 😍 Liz Walters
	5 blocks that cute 🥰
	Chris Barahona it's not, and never has been, about total blocks. It's about the shots you change and the people you NOPE out of shooting and then also blocks. Gobert is the easy DPOY winner
	Mike Brody awe a fan boy with excuses. No one doesn’t that better than Wemby. “Nope” is what he does to the whole league. He just stomped the #1 nuggets. And 7 blocks and throwing In offense is a lot harder than just defense. Wemby the new two way cent… Wyświetl więcej
	Nhol Steph Curry Rahlan did you know that the DPOY with the LOWEST win total ever is Alvin Robertson in 1985 with 35. Wemby doesn't stand a chance. In the future...sure. But Gobert is a lock. Go FanDuel it if you feel so confident
	As Kendrick Perkins would call him “Rudy GoBurr”
	‘Cough cough’ Check again….. ⚡️⚡️
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
	OKC is in 1st in the Western Conference
	Every Filipenis in the comments: 
	They are number two actually behind the thunder. Three way tie that will be broken by Sunday.
	Steven Mosher wolves are #1, it's just not updated yet
	Where the Gobert haters at?
	Thanks to Wemby you mean
	Rudy Rudy Double Doublert 🏀
	we would've been first still if we don't blow the lead at the last second
	Was a good 20minutes. They're 2nd again
	Vanessa Hitchcock
	Rudy Gobert
	Awesome
	First round playoff exit
	Thanks to the spurs
	ANT MVP
	The Goblin💪
	Rudy Gorbet got it
