	60 point blowout...
	  they left when dame and CJ left 🤣🤣🤣
	 🤣🤣🤣
	 so true tho🤣🤣 they was cheeks before CJ and Dame came and now cheeks again after they left 🤣🤣
	 even drexler had to leave Portland to get his first chip.
	" idk why dam stayed so long!!! CJ left and took his team to the playoffs Immediately and dam just stood there like he seen ghost or something. Like boy if you don’t get the hell out of there before you’re 40 😭😭 he could have already had a ri… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 I think because he wanted to  do it the honorable way but eventually he noticed that he can't win anything in Portland
	 yes they are for playing the heat last free agency
	 when CJ left I knew automatically he wasn’t going anywhere! He should have seen himself too!
	 yep thank God he dodged that bullet
	 he got no trade clause
	Senior blow out
	 as if he is omniscient
	 Heat held portland 82 pts with 17 steals.
	 for REAL lol
	 them blazers ain’t tryna win for the rest of the season
	 The defense is them being held to 82 points what do you mean??💀
	 meaning how did the heat stretch that lead in the first place because there was no defense and I guess the blazers were building a house with all those missed shots
	 The heat are way better than than the blazers they have stars compared to the blazers who don’t.
	 yep they are a young team that needs developing and a veteran leadership
	 Portland at this point is basically all rookies and second year players. They’re gonna get wrecked. Especially by a team full of vets and a coach that’s in discussion for best in the league.
	 I guess defense was on Heat's side
	 there is no defence in nba no more
	 I agree.
	 So holding a team to 82 is no defense.  
	Lets go heat
	Super close one!
	Broo the score
	What kind of score is that? It so disappointing that there is a score like that in NBA.
	How does an NBA team of professional athletes lose by 60?
	 I’m available for fun send me an invite if you’re interested
	 simply because of the system.
	 when the losing team is playing mostly rookies as starters it’s pretty easy to understand.
	 tanking for wembanyama 😂
	Heat has very inconsistent season
	60 points apart!! What an emphatic victory.
	If Bryant can do that every game, who knows how far we can make it 
	2nd biggest lead this season behind PORTLAND blowout loss against Oklahoma City.
	 Portland hobby
	Playoffs gonna be good this year
	60 points that's gotta be a record
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Miami Heat
	As an Oregonian, cant our team just be good FINALLY and not be an embarrassment 😭😂 
	Consistency is the key..too achieve more
	Will Wemby be first in the league?
	  What a thrashing!
	insane
	👌🏀🏀
	
	 they made them look like the breakers 😂😂
	🏀🏀🏀🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
	🔥🔥🔥
	First time I see such a blowout and it was from my team! Let’s go HEAT!
	60 points??
	amazing
	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
	wg mo kmi lokohin rey parks..😅
	No highlights from this game?? Nba really disrespect   all the games today except miami had their highlight plays.
	LOL embarassing.
	Insane 60 points difference 😂😂
	60 points lost 🫣🤮
	 uh kakav masakr..
	 bilo je još gore, Heat malo skinuo nogu s gasa, inače u jednom trenutku je išlo ka najvećem porazu u istoriji lige. Mada je i ovo za zabrinuti se ako si u upravi Blazersa...
	 kad im je Scoot najbolji igrač onda je stvarno frka
	 a dobro kad su svi zdravi i na terenu nije on još najbolji igrač te ekipe pored Aytona, Jerami Granta, Simmonsa..
	60pts.?is this nba???
	No mercy!
	Wow, Trail Blazers don’t believe in playing defense 😂 😆 😝
	Where is DominAyton? 🤣🤣🤣
	Black coaches who know that they are in terrible situations and stay are carrying the narrative of so many people who don’t like the color of their skin.
	lmao 60 pts gap lead
	Terry Rozier
	Why is Coach playing for Lottery picks,He won't there next season.
	Massacre
	Unbelievable Dominating Performance For The Heat
	 pretty believable lol
