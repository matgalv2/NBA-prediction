	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Jonel Campuso 
	🤣🤣

	Jonel Campuso do you know how many lebron has triple double in his career
	I would stay away from him in free agency dude is only a number 1 option because the rest of the team is cheeks
	Chicago Mugshots dude got buckets though.
	The Nets should get rid of Simmons sign a replacement who can play more than 75 games a season.
	Please beat the kings for me Sunday
	Patrick Vaughan you do know that won't happen
	Mj is better
	Thomas use this vs Sacramento
	Cam Thomas will be considered as the new main man?
	underrated
	Thomas buwaya
	How have the Pistons not been demoted to the G League yet?? This is insane LOL 💀🤣🗑️
	Michael William Cassidy it's a shame American sport has no promotion/relegation. That's why teams can afford to be bums, it has no consequence.
	Why isnt ben simmons playing?
	Randon thought: Caitlin Clark should declare for the NBA draft instead of the WNBA since Bronny has declared. She would score more and add tons more value to the team who drafts her and break the men/women barrier. Agree? #Share
	Cam Thomas the real
	His face looks AI
	hahaha #nba parley again scouted to lose
	That boy good!
	Cam Thomas
