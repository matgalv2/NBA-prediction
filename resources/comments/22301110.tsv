	Nobody in the nba deserves a ring more than booker. Easily the most under appricated player In the game. Puts up crazy good numbers yet is a complete afterthought in all star voting. Dude’s loyalty is on par with kg/dirk/Duncan/Kobe. He has never said a negative thing about the suns, never asked to be traded during the rock bottom years, if you want booker to be part of a superteam you better come to him.
	kd is the main man💪🔥not a ball hog🙂
	Bro Booker is in top 5
	Super cool
	Devin booker is overated and all talk
	D-Book cooking out there
	Devin Booker, unstoppable

	From April 8th the darkness will accelerate, there will be more and more evil... Do not look at the eclipse or go outside. Turn to GOD - JESUS CHRIST, the warnings are over. I'll leave in my comment what needs to be done 👇🏻👇🏻
	"The world is rotten and people don't mind, we aren´t here to enjoy or have fun, this life is a proof. It´s incredible, no matter how difficult the situation gets, almost no one wants to obey GOD - JESUS CHRIST and TRULY do his will (far away from religious denominations, are all false, without exceptions), as John 14:21 says --&gt; ""He who has my commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my FATHER; and I will love him and manifest myself to him"". And it is true that it is hard to follow HIM, but I also tell you that it is more rewarding than anything in the world ""for what benefit will a man gain if he gains the whole world but loses his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"" Matthew 16:26"
	...AND IS AT THE GATES, THE DOOR OF SALVATION HAS ALMOST BEEN CLOSED.
	"""And I heard another voice from heaven, which said: Come out of her, my people, so that you do not participate in her sins, nor receive part of her plagues; for her sins have reached heaven, and GOD has remembered her wickedness. ."""
	Well, I repeat again. Who does not depart from ALL the system of the world (which is ruled by evil), and leave religious denominations, whose doctrines are wrong, nothing from working in the system of the beast, or going to hospitals, or taking children to school, or going to restaurants... Take the leap of FAITH and let GOD sustain you.
	"""Adulteresses! (refers to souls) Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity toward GOD? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is made an enemy of GOD."""
	"""The LORD JESUS CHRIST does not delay the promise, as some consider it delay, but is patient toward you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."""
	"""He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; he who loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it; and he who loseth his life for my sake shall find it."""
	🔥🔥 Glory and fear of GOD and our LORD JESUS CHRIST that are ONE (John 10:30) 🔥🔥
