TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	Believe me. Without Russell sacrifices the Clippers would be below the 4th spot. Thank him for everything and remember him for everything.
	Pinoy memes thats true
PHX	Welcome To Play In Tournament Suns 👏👏
LAC	Nice You made history with 200 triple doubles, you are an idol, you are really strong. You are not weak, your strength is not weak
LAC	All around player. I hope he wins a chip before he retires
	George Gaswint this is his last chance but the nuggets looks unbeatable
	George Gaswint yes… in china
	Marlon Meliton I think the clips have a chance.
LAC	He always has extra motivation against KD 😂
	Glad my boy got the hell out of the Lakers franchise. Who’s laughing now, y’all holding on by a thread. Have fun playing twice in the play in
LAC	Fantastic stats,amazing 3ple double!
	Steve Arpon Mones what’s your cash app tag for blessing
	Janelle Johnson no thank you mam
LAC	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
PHX	Suns deserve to be a lottery team the way they played this whole year!
LAC	What an awesome performance
LAC	westbrook play is good.. one things he need is a Championship... West is similar to Mitch richmond the real ROCK in Nba
LAC	Nice work Russell
	Chris Paynter what’s your cash app tag for blessing
LAC	Westbrook is god bby!!!!!
LAC	Heart,Clipper (if Russell is active) and Warriors are activated. They are a threat to everyone.
	Layla Luna
PHX	The Suns score 33 points while being down 33 in the first half as a tribute to Grant Hill! 😤😩😭💀🤣
LAC	That’s the Westbrook we know. OKC time..👍💯
LAC	Miss these Westbrook Statelines 😢 cool to see again
LAC	That’s the Russ I know 🔥💪🏽
LAC	Westbrook is a fan favorite to me. And I'm a Rockets fan. I feel like I'm supposed to not like him but the players that have that Dawg get my respect everytime. I got into basketball heavy in 2008-2010 and Westbrook was something to see in his bald head Thunder days.
LAC	Hate him or love him, You need to respect him. He just passed Jerry West on All-time scoring list. #24 MUCH RESPECT
	I’m a Bulls fan but we’re horrible. 
	Brodie still ballin ain't washed yet🔥
LAC	Russell is a legend 💯and I know I’m not alone who thinks or feel the same ❤️
LAC	the triple double king is back.. bench harden and make him as a starting 5..
LAC	Russel is one of the hardest working players in the NBA hardly injured and ready to play.
LAC	Love how hard Russ works - I’m a fan of his no matter where he plays. 💪🏽
LAC	My favorite basketball player of all time. This Oklahoman really misses seeing him in Thunder blue￼. Why not?
	He Have’s Become @ True Team Player 
LAC	That's 199 triple doubles
	I remember when everyone threw west brook under the bus and he just had two bad seasons 🤔
LAC	MR.TRIPLE DOUBLE IS BACK🔥
	1 more td and only brodie will be in the 200 td total club. go go brodie!!
PHX	As a suns fan best of luck in the playoffs clippers. We will be in Cancun because we will lose In The play in
PHX	Then got blown out by the suns🤣🤣
LAC	One championship for mr. triple double russ 💪💪💪
LAC	Russell Westbrook
LAC	Mr triple double ❤
LAC	Prime RUSS is back! 💪🏾
	Zach RayMond Rosal let's see the skateered in playoffssss....

	Eugene Novo agoyyyy diha rang laay pre, no partial no playoff odds

LAC	The Triple double king is Back🔥
PHX	Suns join to play in 😂
LAC	Clips in 6 😤🔥
LAC	199 Career Triple Double 👍
	There is no highlight in YouTube
	Dark Horse
LAC	Mr Triple Double!!!
LAC	Mr 3ple Double is bacl 😎
LAC	Used to hate Westbrook.  Now I root for him
LAC	Russell Westbrook put in work to win
LAC	I love when this man kills it. Brody is an all time great and deserves his flowers 💐 Keep doing you man!
LAC	Start- Russell Westbrook
	Brodee with the triple dub! Nice👏🏼
LAC	If you don’t love Russ, you don’t love Basketball at all…
LAC	Bash him all u want but he's the only one who can pad the stats like this and get a win
	Like the old times 🥲
LAC	Good luck with mavs in the first round 🙂
LAC	Westbrook putting some bricks 🫡
LAC	The triple double machine 😲
	Brodi defence too good today
	Still doing his best game
LAC	I hate to see that game play out as a phx fan,but gotta give credit to clippers, they are a tough team, and Westbrook really does have some mad skills.. kudos, I won't be bitter lol
	Lmao the one time I don’t take him in parlay this foo be ballin 😂😂
	I hope they win the chips
LAC	Heat fan but rooting for the Clippers to win it all this year. Russ needs a chip
	Don't sleep on these cats. The Clippers handily beat the Celtics in Boston back in late January and have won some big games since then. When all their stars are healthy, they can beat any team in the league. Kawhi is still legitimate a two-way threat, and when he returns for the playoffs, the Clippers will be very dangerous.
	"So what! Joker"" overtake in 5 yrs,Whereas, Luka"" before his 30."
LAC	Russ is a real PG. Magic Johnson, Isaiah Thomas   territory. Triple doubles are the the true measure of this position. This is why Steph can be considered in that conversation. Greatest shooter yes but he's not a PG. Russ definitely is and doesn't get enough respect
PHX	but kevin durant couldnt get 5 rebounds on my 4 leg parlay🤣
	Ty Lue should put Russ back in starting 5
PHX	Suns are far
	Lakers could have done with that today. 
LAC	He loves beat KD 😂
	6 points combined in first quarter by 3 superstars paid 128m is sooooo brutal
	Only pg in the l3ague who is considered good for shooting horribly and not being able to make fts... Rondo was scrutinized when he did this with a great fg % of almost 50.
	I pray he gets a ring with this team he deserves one for sure
	That’s number 199! You know he wants the 200 as humble as he is. Lol. Not a huge fan but gotta appreciate his talent.
	The real good plsyers
LAC	Crazy numbers. This the same guy that when 20-20-20 people forget Westbrook is him 💯
LAC	The real Mr. Triple double
	This kat has some of that mamba airness mentality, he always play high energy ball.
PHX	This kind of first quarter from suns was so subpar, 10 points only
	Leonard Sangaalo solar eclipse mode
	Andrew Lao, you wonder what the big 3 was doing
	Leonard Sangaalo no def big 3
LAC	199 triple doubles lol crazy man he gonna hit like maybe 215/220 or more ?
	Terry McGinnis just saying facts. I was a fan of OKC russ. He'll be in the bench once harden is back.
	Ok Po sure thing bud.
	Terry McGinnis if they give him more minutes it's will actually happened more much of that numbers
	Terry McGinnis gonna be his last
	Ok Po just like you. Washed commenting hating on a guy who doesn't know you exist at all lmao this how you feel good about yourself?
	Terry McGinnis hes hating coz they are in play in hahahaha literally a leflop fan. Fun fact!
LAC	Welcome back Triple Double King 🤴 🙌
LAC	westbrook scores 46 in the total 16 points plus 15 assist and plus 15 rebounds
LAC	Say what you want about Westbrook one of my favorite players of all time.  Only player in history of game with back to back seasons of averaging a triple double
LAC	Still not a good three point shooter
	Bro these dudes were up 35 to 4 after 1 quarter, how did they only win by 13?
	the original triple double king 👏👏
	If I could show better then I could tell u was a person he was the scapegoat on every team except okc in glad he’s on a team he can get back to his old self with 😎😎
LAC	Westbrook prime!
LAC	1 more and he at 200 for a career let’s go Brodie
	Get him the starting position back!
LAC	He's always in his prime against KD🤣
LAC	Prime westbrook in harden out
LAC	The king is back, Respect 🙏
	Vintage russ good job👍👍
	Big dawg Brodie playoff mode we need rip lob city new era 💨
LAC	The triple double king is back

LAC	Mr. 3ple double
LAC	Beast. If he can replicate this in the playoffs the clippers can become champions.
PHX	They threw the game to play someone else
LAC	A triple double is normal for him.. The Suns... So much for the big 3

LAC	A very wonderful game.
LAC	Mr tripple double
LAC	He did alot 🔥💪🏾
LAC	Celebrate one player , with pure percentage and 5TOs, cause other team were shooting 10% its ridiculous. I love Russ energy but today basketball need playmaker who must going smart ,slow when you are leading, and wait right moment to attack...with assist or points doesn't matter.

LAC	Westbrook's impact is key to LA's playoff run.
LAC	Nice performance
LAC	After this westbrook is 1-16 fg
LAC	Wes!
LAC	king of triple double 🙌
LAC	my collection highlights 💀
LAC	The Clips revitalized my guys career. Shout-out to Balmer all the way down.
LAC	ALWAYS LOVE HIS ENERGY!
LAC	He loves kd so much
LAC	The Fact They Were Up 37-4 in the first and only Won by 13 should be alarming to the clippers
	Pacific Division Champs!!! Lakers who? Sun's who? Kings who? Warriors who? 😩😩😩
LAC	He is back!!
	6th man of the year
LAC	Yes Triple Double Kings. Now one more to 200 👑💪💯🔥
LAC	He's like that solar Eclipse,he shows up every couple of years🤔🤫🤷🏽‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂
LAC	I did not see it. Was Russ guarding Booker? Because someone locked him up all game!
PHX	Look at the shooting percentages on Phoenix! Booker and Durant especially! They were so incredibly bad. How did LA do it?
LAC	Prime Westbrook is coming
