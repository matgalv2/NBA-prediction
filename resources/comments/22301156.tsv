TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Believe me. Without Russell sacrifices the Clippers would be below the 4th spot. Thank him for everything and remember him for everything.
	Pinoy memes thats true
	Welcome To Play In Tournament Suns 👏👏
	Nice You made history with 200 triple doubles, you are an idol, you are really strong. You are not weak, your strength is not weak
	All around player. I hope he wins a chip before he retires
	George Gaswint this is his last chance but the nuggets looks unbeatable
	George Gaswint yes… in china
	Marlon Meliton I think the clips have a chance.
	He always has extra motivation against KD 😂
	Glad my boy got the hell out of the Lakers franchise. Who’s laughing now, y’all holding on by a thread. Have fun playing twice in the play in
	Fantastic stats,amazing 3ple double!
	Steve Arpon Mones what’s your cash app tag for blessing
	Janelle Johnson no thank you mam
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Suns deserve to be a lottery team the way they played this whole year!
	What an awesome performance
	westbrook play is good.. one things he need is a Championship... West is similar to Mitch richmond the real ROCK in Nba
	Nice work Russell
	Chris Paynter what’s your cash app tag for blessing
	Westbrook is god bby!!!!!
	Heart,Clipper (if Russell is active) and Warriors are activated. They are a threat to everyone.
	Layla Luna
	The Suns score 33 points while being down 33 in the first half as a tribute to Grant Hill! 😤😩😭💀🤣
	That’s the Westbrook we know. OKC time..👍💯
	Miss these Westbrook Statelines 😢 cool to see again
	That’s the Russ I know 🔥💪🏽
	Westbrook is a fan favorite to me. And I'm a Rockets fan. I feel like I'm supposed to not like him but the players that have that Dawg get my respect everytime. I got into basketball heavy in 2008-2010 and Westbrook was something to see in his bald head Thunder days.
	Hate him or love him, You need to respect him. He just passed Jerry West on All-time scoring list. #24 MUCH RESPECT
	I’m a Bulls fan but we’re horrible. 
	Brodie still ballin ain't washed yet🔥
	Russell is a legend 💯and I know I’m not alone who thinks or feel the same ❤️
	the triple double king is back.. bench harden and make him as a starting 5..
	Russel is one of the hardest working players in the NBA hardly injured and ready to play.
	Love how hard Russ works - I’m a fan of his no matter where he plays. 💪🏽
	My favorite basketball player of all time. This Oklahoman really misses seeing him in Thunder blue￼. Why not?
	He Have’s Become @ True Team Player 
	That's 199 triple doubles
	I remember when everyone threw west brook under the bus and he just had two bad seasons 🤔
	MR.TRIPLE DOUBLE IS BACK🔥
	1 more td and only brodie will be in the 200 td total club. go go brodie!!
	As a suns fan best of luck in the playoffs clippers. We will be in Cancun because we will lose In The play in
	Then got blown out by the suns🤣🤣
	One championship for mr. triple double russ 💪💪💪
	Russell Westbrook
	Mr triple double ❤
	Prime RUSS is back! 💪🏾
	Zach RayMond Rosal let's see the skateered in playoffssss....

	199 Career Triple Double 👍
	There is no highlight in YouTube
	Dark Horse
	Mr Triple Double!!!
	Mr 3ple Double is bacl 😎
	Used to hate Westbrook.  Now I root for him
	Russell Westbrook put in work to win
	I love when this man kills it. Brody is an all time great and deserves his flowers 💐 Keep doing you man!
	Start- Russell Westbrook 
	Brodee with the triple dub! Nice👏🏼
	If you don’t love Russ, you don’t love Basketball at all…
	Bash him all u want but he's the only one who can pad the stats like this and get a win
	Like the old times 🥲
	Good luck with mavs in the first round 🙂
	Westbrook putting some bricks 🫡
	The triple double machine 😲
	Brodi defence too good today
	Still doing his best game
	I hate to see that game play out as a phx fan,but gotta give credit to clippers, they are a tough team, and Westbrook really does have some mad skills.. kudos, I won't be bitter lol
	Lmao the one time I don’t take him in parlay this foo be ballin 😂😂
	I hope they win the chips
	Heat fan but rooting for the Clippers to win it all this year. Russ needs a chip
	Don't sleep on these cats. The Clippers handily beat the Celtics in Boston back in late January and have won some big games since then. When all their stars are healthy, they can beat any team in the league. Kawhi is still legitimate a two-way threat, and when he returns for the playoffs, the Clippers will be very dangerous.
	"So what! Joker"" overtake in 5 yrs,Whereas, Luka"" before his 30."
	Russ is a real PG. Magic Johnson, Isaiah Thomas   territory. Triple doubles are the the true measure of this position. This is why Steph can be considered in that conversation. Greatest shooter yes but he's not a PG. Russ definitely is and doesn't get enough respect
	but kevin durant couldnt get 5 rebounds on my 4 leg parlay🤣
	Ty Lue should put Russ back in starting 5
	Suns are far
	Lakers could have done with that today. 
	He loves beat KD 😂
	6 points combined in first quarter by 3 superstars paid 128m is sooooo brutal
	Only pg in the l3ague who is considered good for shooting horribly and not being able to make fts... Rondo was scrutinized when he did this with a great fg % of almost 50.
	I pray he gets a ring with this team he deserves one for sure
	That’s number 199! You know he wants the 200 as humble as he is. Lol. Not a huge fan but gotta appreciate his talent.
	The real good plsyers
	Crazy numbers. This the same guy that when 20-20-20 people forget Westbrook is him 💯
	The real Mr. Triple double
	This kat has some of that mamba airness mentality, he always play high energy ball.
	This kind of first quarter from suns was so subpar, 10 points only
	Leonard Sangaalo solar eclipse mode
	Andrew Lao, you wonder what the big 3 was doing
	Leonard Sangaalo no def big 3
	199 triple doubles lol crazy man he gonna hit like maybe 215/220 or more ?
	Terry McGinnis just saying facts. I was a fan of OKC russ. He'll be in the bench once harden is back.
	Ok Po sure thing bud.
	Terry McGinnis if they give him more minutes it's will actually happened more much of that numbers
	Terry McGinnis gonna be his last
	Ok Po just like you. Washed commenting hating on a guy who doesn't know you exist at all lmao this how you feel good about yourself?
	Terry McGinnis hes hating coz they are in play in hahahaha literally a leflop fan. Fun fact!
	Welcome back Triple Double King 🤴 🙌
	westbrook scores 46 in the total 16 points plus 15 assist and plus 15 rebounds
	Say what you want about Westbrook one of my favorite players of all time.  Only player in history of game with back to back seasons of averaging a triple double
	Still not a good three point shooter
	Bro these dudes were up 35 to 4 after 1 quarter, how did they only win by 13?
	the original triple double king 👏👏
	If I could show better then I could tell u was a person he was the scapegoat on every team except okc in glad he’s on a team he can get back to his old self with 😎😎
	Westbrook prime!
	1 more and he at 200 for a career let’s go Brodie
	Get him the starting position back!
	He's always in his prime against KD🤣
	Prime westbrook in harden out
	The king is back, Respect 🙏
	Vintage russ good job👍👍
	Big dawg Brodie playoff mode we need rip lob city new era 💨
	The triple double king is back
	Looking sharp in that jersey! 🏀🔥 Great style, my friend!
	Clippers - Mavs in the first round will be amazing
	Westside Shocker Comes With The Thunder ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Still Even Now!!!!!!!!
	One of the best athletes to ever lace it up.
	Mr triple double still fire
	He’s him
	Gari Lodroño
	Westbrook 🤌
	W for basketball
	Yessssss nice one lodi
	Mr. 3ple double
	Beast. If he can replicate this in the playoffs the clippers can become champions.
	They threw the game to play someone else
	A triple double is normal for him.. The Suns... So much for the big 3
	Good job west
	Brodie back at it!! Miss you in okc bro!!
	He still no jokic!! 💯
	I knew he can get more.

	Triple-double king
	Wemby it's dat you 🤣
	Triple double 👑
	A very wonderful game.
	Mr tripple double
	He did alot 🔥💪🏾
	Celebrate one player , with pure percentage and 5TOs, cause other team were shooting 10% its ridiculous. I love Russ energy but today basketball need playmaker who must going smart ,slow when you are leading, and wait right moment to attack...with assist or points doesn't matter. 
	He’s back!!
	He's back!
	199th triple-double
	He's back!
	Puts some big numbers down
	Huge
	Still have it inside
	He's backkkk!!!
	This team is on fire
	The Brush!!!
	Clippers and Mavs playoff is going to be insane! Hopefully Russell and PG can pull it off without choking every year.
	Brody is back
	First one in a long while
	Westbrook's impact is key to LA's playoff run.
	Nice performance
	After this westbrook is 1-16 fg
	Wes!
	king of triple double 🙌
	my collection highlights 💀
	The Clips revitalized my guys career. Shout-out to Balmer all the way down.
	ALWAYS LOVE HIS ENERGY!
	He loves kd so much
	The Fact They Were Up 37-4 in the first and only Won by 13 should be alarming to the clippers
	Pacific Division Champs!!! Lakers who? Sun's who? Kings who? Warriors who? 😩😩😩
	He is back!!
	6th man of the year
	Yes Triple Double Kings. Now one more to 200 👑💪💯🔥
	He's like that solar Eclipse,he shows up every couple of years🤔🤫🤷🏽‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂
	I did not see it. Was Russ guarding Booker? Because someone locked him up all game!
	Look at the shooting percentages on Phoenix! Booker and Durant especially! They were so incredibly bad. How did LA do it?
	Prime Westbrook is coming

	Welcome to spurs man chip is within reach for you
	Believe me. Without Russell sacrifices the Clippers would be below the 4th spot. Thank him for everything and remember him for everything.
	My beloved Westbrook always has extra motivation against KD 😂
	Hahahaahah but y'all think KD can get a chip in Phoenix yeaaaa ok hahahahahahahha
	He the heart beat of this team if Westbrook out then so are the L.A. Clippers
	The fact that they have all those players and only have 51 wins is insane, they’ll never win a championship
	LAC will be the 2024 NBA Champion 🏆
	Just bring him back to the starting line up and give him more minutes to play..Russ deserves to play as a starter
	Lebron never did this kind of play in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Brodi defence is too good today
