	These 150 point games are
	Great game but highjacking the post to praise Exum. We Aussies stick together and great to seen Green and Exum doing well in the NBA...Exum comes up clutch to take the game into O.T and we love to see it, especially after the hard times he's been through. Go Mavs!
	And the rockets are gone fishing after all the hype 😂
	Totally the BEST game EVER 
	Kyrie gotta be top 5 most offensively skilled PGs in NBA history. Man is a wizard with the ball in his hands lol
	The Rockets had a very good start but thanks to Luka and Kyrie
	Houston will be in next year. Theyve figured out how to win.
	Mavs all in!
	This game was the best game I've watched so Far... the last minute 3 by the Dallas to level the score was crazy...
	Congrats Dallas .. winner in the game .. success for all team dallas, always happy and enjoy your day
	Clippers better get ready come playoff because the Mavs are all in right now
	Fire Udoka right away this is the second game  the Rockets lost up by 3 with very little time. He should had told his guys to foul.
	I'm more impressed with the love and comradery than anything else.  Real TEAM, I  love it!
	Great job my love KIA 🥰 and the Mavs👏
	Great job
	I know Nike is punching the air right now 🤣🤣
	Ramadan Kyrie is on another level!!!
	What a clutch shot from Exum.
	That pureblood work 🔥
	Kyrie  and Luka are deadly duo it's good to see Kyrie playing with his on staight and being focused
	Dud got the second best handles in the nba ..
	🗣️WE MAKING IT TO THE FINALS🏆
	Kyrie is being a reasonable teammate this season.
	After that Rockets bench guy challenged Warriors, they are on a losing streak 😆
	Good luck beating the Mavs in the playoffs.
	Kyrie Irving has 17,156 PST(#102) tied for NBA career high, passing...
	Going to be a tough team to face Post season 👀
	This guy has got his groove back.
	Great game, saw P. J. Washington make 2 3 pointers in over time.  Wish he was still with the Hornets.
	this is my team if my gsw eliminated in play in
	85 points for the duo
	Luka and kyrie had more free throw attempts than all of the rockets
	Kyrie is magic 🙌🏾
	Kyrie is just different
	What a game...
	I mean those boards for his length is crazy
	Go Mavs 😎 
	Smith is the best free throw shooter ahaha
	It is very clear that Kyrie absolutely found a home in Dallas 💙💙
	Phone ring
	That is why ppl should stop bricking free throws
	Let's go Dallas
	The best ❤️
	Dallas came out to play.....
	Even Luka didn’t make his role at first quarter, still they win this game, Mavs really dangerous in playoffs, especially if they all get their rhythm
	Lakers should of grabbed him
	What a beast uncle drew 😍😱🫶🏀🏆👌🔥☝️
	Congrats 👏
	Did anyone play defence?? NBA is a joke
	283 points ! Wow ! They weren't scoring that much in the 80's and 90's Allstar games
	Uncle Drew cooking 🔥
	What a game!🔥 Kyrie and Mavs fought till the end
	As great of a basketball wizard he is, he will not win another chip if he doesn't lower his ego and run it back with LeBron. Kyrie, Lebron and AD will wreak havoc in the NBA
	Congrats mavs team
	Hé must be selected in team usa he deserve it
	Kyrie cooked the Rockets 🤣
	Wow first time inna minute ii seen him get bare free throws he’s a Field Goal Scorer
	Rockets failed to launch theirs😁
	Was there any defense played?
	I hate this game now
	Hope the mavs can go far
	Scoring machine
	Just 4 more games to play!
	Going to tie top
	I like his style of playing ball.
	Kyrie is something else I don't think people understand.
	Jalen Brunson still better this season …
	What a game❣️
	Yes congrats Mavs ♥️
	Thank you on behalf of humankind for blessing us with this selfie
	Better than the no. 30 in gsw
	He is  built different. He performs best on an empty stomach
	Yes, seize the opportunity.😅
	he cooked the Rockets
	Love this guy!
	N he is fasting a a,🤩
	I hate NBA
	officially Rockets are now out to play
	Defense in NBA is dead
	Jalen green was embarrassing them until he had to slow down before he fouled out 4 at the 2q if he would’ve not fouled up maverick would’ve been cooked
	Rockets were rolling , did someone get hurt or did the moon go retrograde?
	Fasting irving is really great...
	🔥🔥🔥
	Ramadhan Kyrie
	Kyrie Irving determined
	Sometime it might actually be cool to see some defense
	Got a little help and never gave up
	Defense doesn’t exist anymore
	Hope they win it all
	Still worse than Flynn
	280 points in a basketball game..insane!
	say night, night to the playoffs Houston
	Greatest free throw shooter my guy 
	sooo many fts
	This match waas❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
	136-147… does anyone play defense anymore?
	That’s all from ALLAH’s blessings and RAMADAN’s holy month, and his hard work; keep up brother 🤲
	Sounds like a defensive struggle lol
	great game👏🏻
	Aight I'm a mavs fan this year
	Dallas teams eliminating Houston teams 2023 and 2024
	Sheeeshhh
	While fasting for Ramadan. It is just incredible 👏👏👏👏❤️
	Also don't forget that he's fasting from dawn to sunset!
	Ramadhan Kyrie!

	Hella'f'match
	All while fasting
	Easy Work💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
	10 people watched this game.
	Ky getting 17 fts 🥹
	The one day i bet him under 💔💯
	It will be OKC and Mavs and it's 50-50 in the 1st round. OKC has bot average offense and defense but Mavs have great offense but less defense so it's equal.
	Uncle driving kids at school 🔥
	Those huge leads don’t mean squat in todays NBA Houston was up by like 25 points at half time 🤦🏻‍♂️
	Love it
	Congratulations
	Houston Rockets Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Congratulations
	Proverbs 3:13
	WHILE FASTING!!! Just amazing!
	Lodi werpa sakalam idol
	I absolutely love that picture and God bless you!!
	Did anyone even try to guard anyone in this game?
	Notice how the Mavs took off once Kyrie returned to the lineup. Luka is a sidekick. Just like Batman made Robin wear that obnoxious outfit to distract villains, Kyrie lets Luka put up absurd numbers while he does the work.
	The Rockets were killing them..what happened?
	Kyrie Irving
	Good for the gsw,houston loss and gsw won😁
	😁
	Luka deserve MVP title 🏆
	Ramadan Kyrie 📿
	Made up numbers
	He lock in and healthy that trouble for the west
	Ramadan Kyrie different! 💪
	that he's real average when he played more minutes in carrying the team
	THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING OUT THOSE FACING

	At this point the rockets need to have a sit down with the GM and make some changes this is ridiculous
	Dallas-9 ✅✅
	These 150 point games are
	Go hard or go home and Rockets chose to go home, they tried tho
