TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DAL	These 150 point games are
DAL	Great game but highjacking the post to praise Exum. We Aussies stick together and great to seen Green and Exum doing well in the NBA...Exum comes up clutch to take the game into O.T and we love to see it, especially after the hard times he's been through. Go Mavs!
HOU	And the rockets are gone fishing after all the hype 😂
	Benedict Mejia I was in a fight with one of the Rocket fans at the beginning of the season when the Rockets were doing great at that time. I said “there are plenty of time for the Rockets to prove they don’t belong in the playoff”. He was really angry and ended up telling me to wait till the season is done and he’d come back. It proved me right the whole time and I’m wondering where he is now.
	Benedict Mejia haha for real. I knew it the whole time
DAL	Totally the BEST game EVER #dallasmavs
DAL	Kyrie gotta be top 5 most offensively skilled PGs in NBA history. Man is a wizard with the ball in his hands lol
DAL	Congrats Dallas .. winner in the game .. success for all team dallas, always happy and enjoy your day
HOU	Houston will be in next year. Theyve figured out how to win.
DAL	Mavs all in!
HOU	The Rockets had a very good start but thanks to Luka and Kyrie
DAL	This game was the best game I've watched so Far... the last minute 3 by the Dallas to level the score was crazy...
DAL	💯
	Smith Brown cool
DAL	Clippers better get ready come playoff because the Mavs are all in right now
DAL	I'm more impressed with the love and comradery than anything else.  Real TEAM, I  love it!
	Fire Udoka right away this is the second game  the Rockets lost up by 3 with very little time. He should had told his guys to foul.
DAL	Great job my love KIA 🥰 and the Mavs👏
DAL	Great job
DAL	I know Nike is punching the air right now 🤣🤣
	💀💀💀
	Chlarenze John Dallas Mavericks point guard Kyrie Irving signed a five-year footwear and apparel contract with the Chinese brand ANTA in June.Sep 21, 2023
	"Prophett ""retro"" deal"
DAL	Ramadan Kyrie is on another level!!!
DAL	Kyrie  and Luka are deadly duo it's good to see Kyrie playing with his on staight and being focused
DAL	What a clutch shot from Exum.
DAL	That pureblood work 🔥
	Greg Damrell Duke in the NBA!!
DAL	Kyrie is being a reasonable teammate this season.
	Dud got the second best handles in the nba ..
	Great game, saw P. J. Washington make 2 3 pointers in over time.  Wish he was still with the Hornets.
DAL	🗣️WE MAKING IT TO THE FINALS🏆
HOU	After that Rockets bench guy challenged Warriors, they are on a losing streak 😆
DAL	Good luck beating the Mavs in the playoffs.
	This guy has got his groove back.
DAL	this is my team if my gsw eliminated in play in
DAL	Going to be a tough team to face Post season 👀
DAL	Kyrie Irving has 17,156 PST(#102) tied for NBA career high, passing...
DAL	Kyrie is magic 🙌🏾
DAL	85 points for the duo
DAL	Kyrie is just different
DAL	Luka and kyrie had more free throw attempts than all of the rockets
	💀
	Lucas K Letoaba you mean tell the nba to stop rigging games like it’s the wwe
DAL	What a game...
DAL	I mean those boards for his length is crazy
DAL	Go Mavs 😎 #WeComing
DAL	Smith is the best free throw shooter ahaha
DAL	It is very clear that Kyrie absolutely found a home in Dallas 💙💙
	Phone ring
	Benjie Lenzpo but you will never get invited unless it’s a Facebook cookout
	That is why ppl should stop bricking free throws
DAL	Let's go Dallas
DAL	The best ❤️
DAL	Even Luka didn’t make his role at first quarter, still they win this game, Mavs really dangerous in playoffs, especially if they all get their rhythm
	Kym De la Piedra In all fairness (and I am a Mavs fan), if Jabari had hit just one FT, it was over. Luckily, he blew it and Exum did his best with his buzzer beater tying shot.
	Fuad Nazal  yeah but in the end win is win. Handling pressure is still part of a game and a skills.
	Kym De la Piedra Absolutely. The pressure put on Exum was out of the charts, and yet, he did it. Also, losing by 22, and cutting down that lead. No need to say that this is a solid team.
DAL	Dallas came out to play.....
DAL	Lakers should of grabbed him
DAL	What a beast uncle drew 😍😱🫶🏀🏆👌🔥☝️
DAL	Congrats 👏
DAL	Did anyone play defence?? NBA is a joke
	283 points ! Wow ! They weren't scoring that much in the 80's and 90's Allstar games
	Uncle Drew cooking 🔥
DAL	What a game!🔥 Kyrie and Mavs fought till the end
DAL	As great of a basketball wizard he is, he will not win another chip if he doesn't lower his ego and run it back with LeBron. Kyrie, Lebron and AD will wreak havoc in the NBA
DAL	Congrats mavs team
DAL	Hé must be selected in team usa he deserve it
DAL	Kyrie cooked the Rockets 🤣
	Wow first time inna minute ii seen him get bare free throws he’s a Field Goal Scorer
HOU	Rockets failed to launch theirs😁
HOU	Was there any defense played?
	I hate this game now
DAL	Hope the mavs can go far
DAL	Just 4 more games to play!
DAL	Going to tie top
DAL	I like his style of playing ball.
DAL	Kyrie is something else I don't think people understand.
	Jalen Brunson still better this season …
	What a game❣️
DAL	Yes congrats Mavs ♥️
	Thank you on behalf of humankind for blessing us with this selfie
DAL	Better than the no. 30 in gsw
DAL	He is  built different. He performs best on an empty stomach
DAL	Yes, seize the opportunity.😅
DAL	he cooked the Rockets
DAL	Love this guy!
DAL	N he is fasting a a,🤩
	I hate NBA
HOU	officially Rockets are now out to play
HOU	Defense in NBA is dead
	Jalen green was embarrassing them until he had to slow down before he fouled out 4 at the 2q if he would’ve not fouled up maverick would’ve been cooked
HOU	Rockets were rolling , did someone get hurt or did the moon go retrograde?
DAL	Fasting irving is really great...
DAL	🔥🔥🔥
	Ramadhan Kyrie
DAL	Kyrie Irving determined
HOU	Sometime it might actually be cool to see some defense
	Got a little help and never gave up
DAL	Defense doesn’t exist anymore
DAL	Hope they win it all
	Still worse than Flynn
	280 points in a basketball game..insane!
	say night, night to the playoffs Houston
	Greatest free throw shooter my guy Jabari Smith Jr
	sooo many fts
DAL	This match waas❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
	136-147… does anyone play defense anymore?

DAL	Ky getting 17 fts 🥹
	The one day i bet him under 💔💯
DAL	It will be OKC and Mavs and it's 50-50 in the 1st round. OKC has bot average offense and defense but Mavs have great offense but less defense so it's equal.
	Uncle driving kids at school 🔥
DAL	Those huge leads don’t mean squat in todays NBA Houston was up by like 25 points at half time 🤦🏻‍♂️
DAL	Love it
DAL	Congratulations
	Houston Rockets Vs Dallas Mavericks
DAL	Congratulations
	Proverbs 3:13
DAL	WHILE FASTING!!! Just amazing!
	Lodi werpa sakalam idol
DAL	I absolutely love that picture and God bless you!!
	Did anyone even try to guard anyone in this game?
DAL	Notice how the Mavs took off once Kyrie returned to the lineup. Luka is a sidekick. Just like Batman made Robin wear that obnoxious outfit to distract villains, Kyrie lets Luka put up absurd numbers while he does the work.
HOU	The Rockets were killing them..what happened?
DAL	Kyrie Irving
HOU	Good for the gsw,houston loss and gsw won😁
	😁
DAL	Luka deserve MVP title 🏆
DAL	Ramadan Kyrie 📿
DAL	Made up numbers
DAL	He lock in and healthy that trouble for the west
DAL	Ramadan Kyrie different! 💪

HOU	At this point the rockets need to have a sit down with the GM and make some changes this is ridiculous
	Dallas-9 ✅✅
	These 150 point games are
HOU	Go hard or go home and Rockets chose to go home, they tried tho
DAL	Ramadan Power
