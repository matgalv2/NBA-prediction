TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	These 150 point games are
	Great game but highjacking the post to praise Exum. We Aussies stick together and great to seen Green and Exum doing well in the NBA...Exum comes up clutch to take the game into O.T and we love to see it, especially after the hard times he's been through. Go Mavs!
	And the rockets are gone fishing after all the hype 😂
	Benedict Mejia I was in a fight with one of the Rocket fans at the beginning of the season when the Rockets were doing great at that time. I said “there are plenty of time for the Rockets to prove they don’t belong in the playoff”. He was really angry and ended up telling me to wait till the season is done and he’d come back. It proved me right the whole time and I’m wondering where he is now.
	Benedict Mejia haha for real. I knew it the whole time
	Totally the BEST game EVER #dallasmavs
	Kyrie gotta be top 5 most offensively skilled PGs in NBA history. Man is a wizard with the ball in his hands lol
	Congrats Dallas .. winner in the game .. success for all team dallas, always happy and enjoy your day
	Houston will be in next year. Theyve figured out how to win.
	Mavs all in!
	The Rockets had a very good start but thanks to Luka and Kyrie
	This game was the best game I've watched so Far... the last minute 3 by the Dallas to level the score was crazy...
	💯
	Smith Brown cool
	Clippers better get ready come playoff because the Mavs are all in right now
	I'm more impressed with the love and comradery than anything else.  Real TEAM, I  love it!
	Fire Udoka right away this is the second game  the Rockets lost up by 3 with very little time. He should had told his guys to foul.
	Great job my love KIA 🥰 and the Mavs👏
	Great job
	I know Nike is punching the air right now 🤣🤣
	💀💀💀
	Chlarenze John Dallas Mavericks point guard Kyrie Irving signed a five-year footwear and apparel contract with the Chinese brand ANTA in June.Sep 21, 2023
	"Prophett ""retro"" deal"
	Ramadan Kyrie is on another level!!!
	Kyrie  and Luka are deadly duo it's good to see Kyrie playing with his on staight and being focused
	What a clutch shot from Exum.
	That pureblood work 🔥
	Greg Damrell Duke in the NBA!!
	Kyrie is being a reasonable teammate this season.
	Dud got the second best handles in the nba ..
	Great game, saw P. J. Washington make 2 3 pointers in over time.  Wish he was still with the Hornets.
	🗣️WE MAKING IT TO THE FINALS🏆
	After that Rockets bench guy challenged Warriors, they are on a losing streak 😆
	Good luck beating the Mavs in the playoffs.
	This guy has got his groove back.
	this is my team if my gsw eliminated in play in
	Going to be a tough team to face Post season 👀
	Kyrie Irving has 17,156 PST(#102) tied for NBA career high, passing...
	Kyrie is magic 🙌🏾
	85 points for the duo
	Kyrie is just different
	Luka and kyrie had more free throw attempts than all of the rockets
	💀
	Lucas K Letoaba you mean tell the nba to stop rigging games like it’s the wwe
	What a game...
	I mean those boards for his length is crazy
	Go Mavs 😎 #WeComing
	Smith is the best free throw shooter ahaha
	It is very clear that Kyrie absolutely found a home in Dallas 💙💙
	Phone ring
	Benjie Lenzpo but you will never get invited unless it’s a Facebook cookout
	That is why ppl should stop bricking free throws
	Let's go Dallas
	The best ❤️
	Even Luka didn’t make his role at first quarter, still they win this game, Mavs really dangerous in playoffs, especially if they all get their rhythm
	Kym De la Piedra In all fairness (and I am a Mavs fan), if Jabari had hit just one FT, it was over. Luckily, he blew it and Exum did his best with his buzzer beater tying shot.
	Fuad Nazal  yeah but in the end win is win. Handling pressure is still part of a game and a skills.
	Kym De la Piedra Absolutely. The pressure put on Exum was out of the charts, and yet, he did it. Also, losing by 22, and cutting down that lead. No need to say that this is a solid team.
	Dallas came out to play.....
	Lakers should of grabbed him
	What a beast uncle drew 😍😱🫶🏀🏆👌🔥☝️
	Congrats 👏
	Did anyone play defence?? NBA is a joke
	283 points ! Wow ! They weren't scoring that much in the 80's and 90's Allstar games
	Uncle Drew cooking 🔥
	What a game!🔥 Kyrie and Mavs fought till the end
	As great of a basketball wizard he is, he will not win another chip if he doesn't lower his ego and run it back with LeBron. Kyrie, Lebron and AD will wreak havoc in the NBA
	Congrats mavs team
	Hé must be selected in team usa he deserve it
	Kyrie cooked the Rockets 🤣
	Wow first time inna minute ii seen him get bare free throws he’s a Field Goal Scorer
	Rockets failed to launch theirs😁
	Was there any defense played?
	I hate this game now
	Hope the mavs can go far
	Just 4 more games to play!
	Going to tie top
	I like his style of playing ball.
	Kyrie is something else I don't think people understand.
	Jalen Brunson still better this season …
	What a game❣️
	Yes congrats Mavs ♥️
	Thank you on behalf of humankind for blessing us with this selfie
	Better than the no. 30 in gsw
	He is  built different. He performs best on an empty stomach
	Yes, seize the opportunity.😅
	he cooked the Rockets
	Love this guy!
	N he is fasting a a,🤩
	I hate NBA
	officially Rockets are now out to play
	Defense in NBA is dead
	Jalen green was embarrassing them until he had to slow down before he fouled out 4 at the 2q if he would’ve not fouled up maverick would’ve been cooked
	Rockets were rolling , did someone get hurt or did the moon go retrograde?
	Fasting irving is really great...
	🔥🔥🔥
	Ramadhan Kyrie
	Kyrie Irving determined
	Sometime it might actually be cool to see some defense
	Got a little help and never gave up
	Defense doesn’t exist anymore
	Hope they win it all
	Still worse than Flynn
	280 points in a basketball game..insane!
	say night, night to the playoffs Houston
	Greatest free throw shooter my guy Jabari Smith Jr
	sooo many fts
	This match waas❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
	136-147… does anyone play defense anymore?
	That’s all from ALLAH’s blessings and RAMADAN’s holy month, and his hard work; keep up brother 🤲
	Sounds like a defensive struggle lol
	great game👏🏻
	Aight I'm a mavs fan this year
	Dallas teams eliminating Houston teams 2023 and 2024

	10 people watched this game.
	Ky getting 17 fts 🥹
	The one day i bet him under 💔💯
	It will be OKC and Mavs and it's 50-50 in the 1st round. OKC has bot average offense and defense but Mavs have great offense but less defense so it's equal.
	Uncle driving kids at school 🔥
	Those huge leads don’t mean squat in todays NBA Houston was up by like 25 points at half time 🤦🏻‍♂️
	Love it
	Congratulations
	Houston Rockets Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Congratulations

	WHILE FASTING!!! Just amazing!
	Lodi werpa sakalam idol
	I absolutely love that picture and God bless you!!
	Did anyone even try to guard anyone in this game?
	Notice how the Mavs took off once Kyrie returned to the lineup. Luka is a sidekick. Just like Batman made Robin wear that obnoxious outfit to distract villains, Kyrie lets Luka put up absurd numbers while he does the work.
	The Rockets were killing them..what happened?
	Kyrie Irving
	Good for the gsw,houston loss and gsw won😁
	😁
	Luka deserve MVP title 🏆
	Ramadan Kyrie 📿
	Made up numbers
	He lock in and healthy that trouble for the west
	Ramadan Kyrie different! 💪
	that he's real average when he played more minutes in carrying the team
	THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING OUT THOSE FACING

	Brian Wayne Boyett Me too, cause that means Dallas is in the finals!
	❤️❤️❤️
	At this point the rockets need to have a sit down with the GM and make some changes this is ridiculous
	Dallas-9 ✅✅
	These 150 point games are
	Go hard or go home and Rockets chose to go home, they tried tho
	Ramadan Power
