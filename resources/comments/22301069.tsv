	 ayooooooooo pause
	 Let me slide up in them guts, boi.
	Josh Diddy
	 imagine thinking this is original or funny
	 imagine defending a pedo 🤡
	Perv should be in prison
	 you sound mad
	 really shouldn’t you nonce
	 lol she was at a club that she snuck into and lied to him saying she was 19 and he was 21, and as soon as he found out how old she really was he immediately stopped talking to her….
	 sooo that makes it ok ? 🤣   nope
	 I didn’t say that makes it okay, but if you’re 21 and talking to a 19 year old nothing wrong with that, she lied to him, he didn’t even know
	 I doubt that.
	 stop putting the blame on an underage person. He’s an adult. He should have the blame. So weird people defend him.
	 lol they literally met in a club, you don’t expect to see kids in there because they shouldn’t be in there…
	 maybe he shouldn’t have gone to a club that has minors in it or maybe that’s what he wanted.
	 dude club as in bar with alcohol…. Are you really that stupid or just trolling? 😂😂
	" A grown adult that’s in the NBA would check if someone was of age. I don’t think it’s fair to bash a girl who is maybe starstruck by someone who is in the NBA. I don’t think it’s fair people are blaming someone that is a minor in this ca… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 I sure hope this never happens to your kid. You might feel differently when an adult man grooms your kid. Just saying.
	 dude it’s a bar, the bouncer should’ve done a better job checking everyone’s id , he does know better, hence why he stopped talking to her the second he found out she lied about her age, you’re not all there jimbo 😂
	 yes put the blame on anyone but him. I don’t believe it. Did he stop talking to her before or after all the pictures on the internet? Stop supporting child abusers.
	 I don’t support child abusers, dude you sound dumb af, feels like I’m arguing with a vegetable
	 you don’t have to believe go do research, when the story first surfaced I felt the same way thought he was a terrible person but then I actually did research and found out what really happened….
	 I agree! He took advantage of a young girl. He’s an adult and should have known better. The people that support him should be ashamed.
	ew who supports pedo’s🤣
	Me
	 I agree! The fan base is from Oklahoma. That answers them supporting him!
	 SICKEST EVER!
	 It’s so sad to hear people attack a minor over a grown adult. It’s insane!  Our society is screwed up. If it was their daughter they would not feel the same way.
