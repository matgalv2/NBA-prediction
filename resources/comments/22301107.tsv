TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
MEM	At this rate, they'll be so humiliated at the POs, so much so that it would have been better they never made it.
	Nosakhare Ohuimumwen i hope so.
MIL	If not for Adrian Griffin leading this bucks team to 30 wins before getting fired they could've easily been a play in team.
MIL	Back to back losses for the bucks  they have to get it together.
	Tyrone Moore to bad teams
	💯
MIL	So this what happens when Dame is not around?
MIL	Doc Rivers will pretend this is his master plan to avoid the Heat by tanking a bit, but he just schemed his way in, got close to the right people, got some dudes fired but does not know a lick what he is doing. Just got lucky with 1 ring with a superteam that's it. He and Ty Lue, are overrated.😆
MIL	Trying to avoid the Heat? 😅
MIL	Doc Rivers already in playoffs mode 🤣
MIL	what is happening with the Bucks?
MIL	Defeat by wizard and now in Memphis 😄🙈
MIL	Poor Bucks. They should’ve kept Holiday, Grayson Allen.
MIL	Let Thanasis Play.
MEM	JJJ CELEBRATE THE FINAL MVP IN 2025 SOON GOD BLESS TEAMS🙏🙌.
MEM	Jaren Jackson Jr in the mood to play
MIL	For some reason I think we tanking for the 3rd seed or the guyz have given up on Doc already,but if that is the case who is to blame
MIL	Bro the bucks are a complete mess right now. They fired Mike, then they fired Adrian, now they struggling with doc, there is something there that the bucks are missing, because they are awful right now.
MIL	They dont have Dame thats why they're struggling. 😅
MEM	"Typical NBA post : the season is a total failure for the Grizzlies, the highly paid Jackson does nothing and here we are, showing his ""great stats"" in a game against an underperforming opponent"
MIL	Bucks lose to Washington and Memphis in the same week?? Love to see it
MEM	JJj follow your father
MIL	A certain coach is washed
MEM	Great game..I like it
MEM	Looking forward to next game.👋
MEM	Nice game bucks
MEM	We fine in the west
MIL	Fire Choke Rivers!
MEM	Nice game hahaha
MEM	Nice game hahaha
MIL	Easy Bucks😜😜
MEM	🔥🔥
	Brett Flematti
MIL	Bucks is player problem not a coach
MEM	Play Good
MEM	Wow Milwaukee.  Losing back to back games to sub 0.500 teams,putting that #2 seed in jeopardy with only a few games remaining until playoffs.
MIL	Dame is whack!!! He made Milwaukee regular, they went for the big name and messed up the chemistry.
MEM	Thank you Thanasis
MEM	Unbelievable
	Memphis Grizzlies Vs Milwaukee Bucks
MIL	Just here for the Doc comments
MIL	I still don't understand why team thinks Doc River is the man for the job. He won one livku ring with the Celts. He's good at checking
MIL	Bad night for Milwaukee
MEM	My king
MIL	Bucks and Pacers lost to below-average teams. A reminder of how wonderful the NBA is in creating a game script.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦
MIL	The Bucks are 🗑️🤣
