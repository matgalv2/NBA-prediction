TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	At this rate, they'll be so humiliated at the POs, so much so that it would have been better they never made it.
	Nosakhare Ohuimumwen i hope so.
	If not for Adrian Griffin leading this bucks team to 30 wins before getting fired they could've easily been a play in team.
	Back to back losses for the bucks  they have to get it together.
	Tyrone Moore to bad teams
	💯
	So this what happens when Dame is not around?
	Doc Rivers will pretend this is his master plan to avoid the Heat by tanking a bit, but he just schemed his way in, got close to the right people, got some dudes fired but does not know a lick what he is doing. Just got lucky with 1 ring with a superteam that's it. He and Ty Lue, are overrated.😆
	Trying to avoid the Heat? 😅
	Doc Rivers already in playoffs mode 🤣
	what is happening with the Bucks?
	Defeat by wizard and now in Memphis 😄🙈
	Poor Bucks. They should’ve kept Holiday, Grayson Allen.
	Let Thanasis Play.
	JJJ CELEBRATE THE FINAL MVP IN 2025 SOON GOD BLESS TEAMS🙏🙌.
	Jaren Jackson Jr in the mood to play
	For some reason I think we tanking for the 3rd seed or the guyz have given up on Doc already,but if that is the case who is to blame
	Bro the bucks are a complete mess right now. They fired Mike, then they fired Adrian, now they struggling with doc, there is something there that the bucks are missing, because they are awful right now.
	They dont have Dame thats why they're struggling. 😅
	"Typical NBA post : the season is a total failure for the Grizzlies, the highly paid Jackson does nothing and here we are, showing his ""great stats"" in a game against an underperforming opponent"
	Bucks lose to Washington and Memphis in the same week?? Love to see it
	JJj follow your father
	A certain coach is washed
	Great game..I like it
	Looking forward to next game.👋
	Nice game bucks
	We fine in the west
	Fire Choke Rivers!
	Nice game hahaha
	Nice game hahaha
	Easy Bucks😜😜
	🔥🔥

	Bucks is player problem not a coach
	Play Good
	Wow Milwaukee.  Losing back to back games to sub 0.500 teams,putting that #2 seed in jeopardy with only a few games remaining until playoffs.
	Dame is whack!!! He made Milwaukee regular, they went for the big name and messed up the chemistry.
	Thank you Thanasis
	Unbelievable
	Memphis Grizzlies Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	Just here for the Doc comments
	I still don't understand why team thinks Doc River is the man for the job. He won one livku ring with the Celts. He's good at checking
	Bad night for Milwaukee
	My king
	Bucks and Pacers lost to below-average teams. A reminder of how wonderful the NBA is in creating a game script.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦
	The Bucks are 🗑️🤣
