	At this rate, they'll be so humiliated at the POs, so much so that it would have been better they never made it.
	 i hope so.
	If not for Adrian Griffin leading this bucks team to 30 wins before getting fired they could've easily been a play in team.
	Back to back losses for the bucks  they have to get it together.
	 they just avoiding Miami at all cost…
	 to bad teams
	 playing relaxed based on their team standing ?
	 yeah it,s there back to back losses
	you got potential don't waste it... I GAT SOME FOR  HMU RN 💯
	Patalo ba o Namimili ng kalaban ang bucks sa play offs ayaw siguro mkatapat ang heat
	 ayw talaga
	L.A ang nkakatakot klbn
	So this what happens when Dame is not around?
	Doc Rivers will pretend this is his master plan to avoid the Heat by tanking a bit, but he just schemed his way in, got close to the right people, got some dudes fired but does not know a lick what he is doing. Just got lucky with 1 ring with a <a tabindex=
	
	 Ty Lue is not overrated
	Trying to avoid the Heat? 😅
	They just don’t wanna play Miami 🥱
	you got potential don't waste it... I GAT SOME FOR  HMU RN 💯
	Doc Rivers already in playoffs mode 🤣
	Defeat by wizard and now in Memphis 😄🙈
	what is happening with the Bucks?
	 doc rivers
	 It's Doc time!...man is locked in and in playoff mode
	Let Thanasis Play.
	Poor Bucks. They should’ve kept Holiday, Grayson Allen.
	JJJ CELEBRATE THE FINAL MVP IN 2025 SOON GOD BLESS TEAMS🙏🙌.
	They dont have Dame thats why they're struggling. 😅
	Bro the bucks are a complete mess right now. They fired Mike, then they fired Adrian, now they struggling with doc, there is something there that the bucks are missing, because they are awful right now.
	Lillard and Middleton are injured. They supposed to lose.
	Jaren Jackson Jr in the mood to play
	For some reason I think we tanking for the 3rd seed or the guyz have given up on Doc already,but if that is the case who is to blame
	Throw your coach
	We fine in the west
	"Typical NBA post : the season is a total failure for the Grizzlies, the highly paid Jackson does nothing and here we are, showing his ""great stats"" in a game against an underperforming opponent"
	Bucks lose to Washington and Memphis in the same week?? Love to see it
	A certain coach is washed
	Great game..I like it
	JJj follow your father
	Fire Choke Rivers!
	Looking forward to next game.👋
	Nice game bucks
	Nice game hahaha
	Nice game hahaha
	My tiwala pa din aq sa bucks walang sukuan Bucks pa din aq Go Gianni's at sa bucks player 🙏🙏
	Easy Bucks😜😜
	Namimili ata ng kalaban ang bucks sa playoffs, panay talo eh. 🤣🤭
	HAHAHA hayssss
	Wow Milwaukee.  Losing back to back games to sub 0.500 teams,putting that #2 seed in jeopardy with only a few games remaining until playoffs.
	palitan ng coach ang bucks malas yan 🤣🤣🤣
	Thank you Thanasis
	Dame is whack!!! He made Milwaukee regular, they went for the big name and messed up the chemistry.
	Memphis Grizzlies Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	Just here for the Doc comments
