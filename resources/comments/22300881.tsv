	Man, we got the W, but having the friendly whistle when we seldom get it and having it this close...... Moral loss. 37 FT to 11. We should have won this by at least 30. Way to step up offensively Rudy G, we needed it tonight.
	David Martodam yea we looked like shit, I was there but it didn’t even feel like a real win walking out tbh.
	The anchor ⚓️ to the defense.
	Defensive player of the year
	Barely beat the Blazers B team because Ant just stood around doing nothing most of the game
	The Goblin
	What do you think Luka will accomplish?
	Way to go Blazers, almost got the win
	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
	Rudy Gobert
	Portland Trail Blazers Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
	Rudy too disrespected
	“Worst trade ever “

	Hello how are you
	"Imma do this once sending 5 grand to the first 6 people to hmu with ""GOD IS GOOD"" cus i feel some people going through difficulties, Y'all stay Blessed"
	The starters for Minnesota played Portland's deep bench. One starter played for Portland.  Great job Blazers! Imagine everyone healthy for the Blazers.
	🤷🏼‍♂️ it’s the NBA not gonna win by 40 every night
	Carolyn Dierking it wouldn't have been much different. Their wins and losses are extremely variable.
	Adrian Jones it's called progress.
	Carolyn Dierking Yeah as a Blazers fan I'm elated about this game. Kept it interesting with basically the whole rotation gone, minus Simons who had arguably the best game of his career thus far, and still got to keep the tank rolling.
	"I'm Paying 5 Grands to the first 7 to hit me up now with ""STRIVING"" cus I feel people still going as through HARD TIMES this moment , remain blessed y'all"
