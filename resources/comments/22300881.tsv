MIN	Man, we got the W, but having the friendly whistle when we seldom get it and having it this close...... Moral loss. 37 FT to 11. We should have won this by at least 30. Way to step up offensively Rudy G, we needed it tonight.
MIN	David Martodam yea we looked like shit, I was there but it didn’t even feel like a real win walking out tbh.
MIN	The anchor ⚓️ to the defense.

POR	The starters for Minnesota played Portland's deep bench. One starter played for Portland.  Great job Blazers! Imagine everyone healthy for the Blazers.
MIN	🤷🏼‍♂️ it’s the NBA not gonna win by 40 every night
POR	Carolyn Dierking it wouldn't have been much different. Their wins and losses are extremely variable.
POR	Adrian Jones it's called progress.
POR	Carolyn Dierking Yeah as a Blazers fan I'm elated about this game. Kept it interesting with basically the whole rotation gone, minus Simons who had arguably the best game of his career thus far, and still got to keep the tank rolling.
