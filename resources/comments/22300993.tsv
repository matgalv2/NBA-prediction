	It's great to hear that Zion Williamson had a strong performance to help the New Orleans Pelicans secure a win in Brooklyn! Cam Thomas also put up an impressive 25 points for the Nets. Exciting game all around! 🏀💪🔥
	Dude Wemby can put that easily and he is a rookie , this dude is cooked
	Zion already a top 10 player
	He’s looking great out there ! Always epic to watch dudes strong af too !
	 Absolutely! Zion Williamson is a remarkable talent with his combination of strength, athleticism, and skill on the court. His ability to dominate games and make incredible plays is always a sight to behold. It's definitely epic to watch <a tabindex=💪🔥
	 hell ye
	Zion is the man!!
	he really like that cant wait to see him in the playoffs
	Is 28-7-4 even an impressive stat line in today's NBA? With the video game  being put up??
	I’m happy the pelicans are finally getting some attention💪🏽
	New Orleans Pelicans Vs Brooklyn Nets
	Only took him like 5 years. He's becoming an irrelevant player of not already
	Nice game Zion
	Go Pelicans
	he wants a bigger bag and when its heavy to carry its time to relax
	This team is going to be tough if Zion stays healthy.

	 That's right! Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans are making some noise in the NBA and showing great potential. It's exciting to see them compete and showcase their skills on the court. Geaux Pelicans! 🏀🔥 Let's keep that winning spirit going!
	 Yes, I'm sooo proud of them! Praying 🙏 we finish strong 💪
	💯
	Awesome!  Also from this photo, seems like he's finally putting in the work to condition his body.  Finally taking his job, and all those millions serious! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
	When Zion is healthy and not hurt which is rare, he can be a top 10 basketball player in the NBA currently.
	How is he so bad at rebounding?
	 how is 7 bad with 10 ppl on the court at all times
	 hahahaha what’s his season average? What’s his size? You really said 10 people on the court 😂😅
	 He 6’6 So Majority Of The Time He’s The 2nd Or 3rd Shortest Player On The Court
	 it was a rhetorical question and lololol
	 what the fuck lololol better not comment on anything in life ever again then because, golly gee, no doubt someone can claim supremacy in the chosen topic
	 grown man really just told me golly gee. I'm done here
	he thinks he's a guard
	 he doesn’t give enough
	I “might” start watching him and then again, but I just can’t trust him.
	When healthy he is top 3 PF right now
	Finally, this is the ZION we wanted to see 👍⋯⋯a healthy and lighter version of ZION 👌
	 Zion Williamson's health and fitness are crucial factors in his performance, and it's fantastic to see him in good shape and playing at a high level. When he's healthy and at his best, he's truly a force to be reckoned with on the court. Fans <a tabindex=🏀💪
	 Totally agreed 👍⋯⋯His talent is 💯no doubt and reduces the weight by 25 pounds since DEC has proven that it helps his performance. I can’t wait to see his performance during PLAYOFFS and bring glory to NEW ORLEANS ✅
	Like his game, when he's healthy
	When healthy watch out
	Prove them all wrong about u,  big Z 💪💪💪
