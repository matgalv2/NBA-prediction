TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
NOP	It's great to hear that Zion Williamson had a strong performance to help the New Orleans Pelicans secure a win in Brooklyn! Cam Thomas also put up an impressive 25 points for the Nets. Exciting game all around! 🏀💪🔥
NOP	Zion already a top 10 player
NOP	Tyshon Battle Zion Williamson has shown immense talent and potential, showcasing impressive skills on both ends of the court. While some may consider him a top 10 player already due to his impact on the game, others may believe he still needs more experience and consistency to solidify his place in the top 10. It's certainly exciting to see his development and the impact he's making in the NBA.

NOP	How is he so bad at rebounding?
	Scott Kruitbosch how is 7 bad with 10 ppl on the court at all times
	😂😅
	Scott Kruitbosch He 6’6 So Majority Of The Time He’s The 2nd Or 3rd Shortest Player On The Court
	Woodrow Wright it was a rhetorical question and lololol
	Scott Kruitbosch it's always the mfs that couldn't do remotely as well that are always the first to diss smh
	Erik Lamar what the fuck lololol better not comment on anything in life ever again then because, golly gee, no doubt someone can claim supremacy in the chosen topic
	Scott Kruitbosch grown man really just told me golly gee. I'm done here
NOP	Scott Kruitboschhe thinks he's a guard
	Ed Bukowski he doesn’t give enough
NOP	When Zion is healthy and not hurt which is rare, he can be a top 10 basketball player in the NBA currently.
NOP	I “might” start watching him and then again, but I just can’t trust him.
NOP	When healthy he is top 3 PF right now
NOP	Finally, this is the ZION we wanted to see 👍⋯⋯a healthy and lighter version of ZION 👌
NOP	👍🏀💪
NOP	👍⋯⋯His talent is 💯no doubt and reduces the weight by 25 pounds since DEC has proven that it helps his performance. I can’t wait to see his performance during PLAYOFFS and bring glory to NEW ORLEANS ✅
NOP	Steven Cooley Z!
BKN	Nets will continue to suck unless they get rid of Ben Simmons or he comes back and plays like an all star.
