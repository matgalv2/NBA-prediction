TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	It's great to hear that Zion Williamson had a strong performance to help the New Orleans Pelicans secure a win in Brooklyn! Cam Thomas also put up an impressive 25 points for the Nets. Exciting game all around! 🏀💪🔥
	Zion already a top 10 player
	Tyshon Battle Zion Williamson has shown immense talent and potential, showcasing impressive skills on both ends of the court. While some may consider him a top 10 player already due to his impact on the game, others may believe he still needs more experience and consistency to solidify his place in the top 10. It's certainly exciting to see his development and the impact he's making in the NBA.
	Dude Wemby can put that easily and he is a rookie , this dude is cooked
	😂😂 and Zions team is half a game out the 4th seed… a successful team
	Diego Gómez all that work for 15 wins?
	He’s looking great out there ! Always epic to watch dudes strong af too !
	🏀💪🔥
	Sarah Marshal hell ye
	Zion is the man!!
	Is 28-7-4 even an impressive stat line in today's NBA? With the video game #s being put up??
	Matt Wright pels have multiple 20+ from three or four guys a night. That’s how you win games. Pels are stacked.
	Matt Wright they put up the stat line from the highest scorer of the winning team every day for a few years now bud. Nobody is talking about how impressive it is. Catch up man.
	he really like that cant wait to see him in the playoffs
	I’m happy the pelicans are finally getting some attention💪🏽
	New Orleans Pelicans Vs Brooklyn Nets
	Only took him like 5 years. He's becoming an irrelevant player of not already
	Brandon Dumont injuries tend to do that to you
	Nice game Zion
	Go Pelicans
	he wants a bigger bag and when its heavy to carry its time to relax
	Playoff bound
	This team is going to be tough if Zion stays healthy.
	WTG Big Z Leaux Geaux 🏀
	🏀🔥 Let's keep that winning spirit going!
	Ey tu Dios te Bendiga 🙏🏻💯
	💯
	Awesome!  Also from this photo, seems like he's finally putting in the work to condition his body.  Finally taking his job, and all those millions serious! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
	How is he so bad at rebounding?
	Scott Kruitbosch how is 7 bad with 10 ppl on the court at all times
	😂😅
	Scott Kruitbosch He 6’6 So Majority Of The Time He’s The 2nd Or 3rd Shortest Player On The Court
	Woodrow Wright it was a rhetorical question and lololol
	Scott Kruitbosch it's always the mfs that couldn't do remotely as well that are always the first to diss smh
	Erik Lamar what the fuck lololol better not comment on anything in life ever again then because, golly gee, no doubt someone can claim supremacy in the chosen topic
	Scott Kruitbosch grown man really just told me golly gee. I'm done here
	Scott Kruitboschhe thinks he's a guard
	Ed Bukowski he doesn’t give enough
	When Zion is healthy and not hurt which is rare, he can be a top 10 basketball player in the NBA currently.
	I “might” start watching him and then again, but I just can’t trust him.
	When healthy he is top 3 PF right now
	Finally, this is the ZION we wanted to see 👍⋯⋯a healthy and lighter version of ZION 👌
	👍🏀💪
	👍⋯⋯His talent is 💯no doubt and reduces the weight by 25 pounds since DEC has proven that it helps his performance. I can’t wait to see his performance during PLAYOFFS and bring glory to NEW ORLEANS ✅
	Steven Cooley Z!
	Nets will continue to suck unless they get rid of Ben Simmons or he comes back and plays like an all star.
	Like his game, when he's healthy
	When healthy watch out
	Prove them all wrong about u,  big Z 💪💪💪

	The world is rotten and people don't mind, we aren´t here to enjoy or have fun, this life is a proof. It´s incredible, no matter how difficult the situation gets, almost no one wants to obey GOD - JESUS CHRIST and TRULY do his will (far away from relig… Wyświetl więcej
