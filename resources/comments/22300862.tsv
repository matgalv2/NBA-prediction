TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	Yea you're  a great basketball  player I love to watch you play even with the lakers
SAC	Ty Bauer I told you this kid is all buckets. I love his game.
SAC	He had 45 last year against the Clippers….come on NBA
SAC	Laker fan here, but Kings must work on their free throws during crunch time!
SAC	Mel Yonaryo they work on them every single practice. But you can't emulate crunch time at practice.
SAC	6TH MAN OF YEAR . Light the beam ! 🟣⚫️🟣⚫️🟣⚫️👑🦁
MIN	Justin Ball Edward’s left that’s why wolves lost
SAC	De’Aaron Fox didn’t play either
SAC	He had 40+ last year against the Clippers.
SAC	Great game Sacramento Kings! Malik you played with the heart! Love to see you play.
SAC	Let’s face it, you saved the day again as you frequently do. But next time you have the ball with 7 seconds and the game is tied. Would you please drive towards the basket and either make the shot or get fouled and free throws. Other than that you’re a pretty entertaining player
SAC	We’re just forgetting about the Kings-Clippers game last year where he scored 45? 😂
SAC	Kings needed every one of those and the refs should be ashamed after that game. Elbows and kicks to the groin, head, chest, but yet nothing called when is the NBA gonna do something about officiating this year? Cause it blows! 💯
MIN	Talk about catching a break, when Minnesota’s best player left half way through the game to see his baby being born. King’s definitely needed it.
SAC	Greg Sandoval kings didn’t have fox and the kings have “zero” all stars and it was 8 vs 5 in favor for the wolves. Get outta here we Dawged up and clutched up.
SAC	Michael-Robert Rizo and to be fair, Fox is a great player and without him, it probably was an easy win but Edward’s out, definitely evened the playing field.
SAC	**Season-High** 39 points for Monk vs Wolves. Career-High was 45 points vs Clippers in 176-175 win via 2OT. Fox 42 points, Leonard 44 points.
SAC	Congratulations MVP
SAC	Another truly awesome performance by a player who is clearly the sixth man of the year and still ascending. Keep him!
SAC	Malik Monk really that dude. He showed out when he was on the Lakers a few years back. He hasn't stopped since. One the best pieces to the Kings right now imo
	Emmanuel Harvey is he? Or is that he's a product of the structure of the NBA?
	Ry Guy nah
SAC	Headline should be: Malik drops 35 in 2nd half to help secure victory against the West's top seed
MIN	Chris Hankins without ANT in half time
SAC	Iryne Pantilanan and De'aaron Fox all game
SAC	Iryne Pantilanan Ya'll keep saying that but forget that Fox was out the whole game.
SAC	Malik would be a starter anywhere in the league! But I'm happy he's my 6th man!
SAC	The nba needs to be better his career high is 45
SAC	I thougt his career high was 45?
	Erika Graham Loescher It is. NBA got get a new social media manager
	Erika Graham Loescher same
SAC	There's my boy great job hun congrats to the whole team on that win on to the next game
SAC	Must be looking for a new contract. Like most players act like playing about that time.
SAC	The Kings r playing some fantastic🏀 I definitely enjoy watching them.
SAC	kings is that team can beat any team hit or miss
SAC	Swore he dropped 40 something last year with multiple clutch baskets
	Tutu Euv he did. NBA is slipping
SAC	MOST UNDERRATED STAR IN THE NBA.🏀
SAC	*Season High
SAC	Most as a starter?
SAC	Alexander Reynolds didn’t start.
SAC	Danny McKevitt that wasn't monks career high, so I figured they meant starting vs off the bench
	Thought Udonis Haslem came out of retirement for a sec
SAC	This isn't true. He scored over 40 last season and his buddy De'Aaron had over 40 in that same game again the Clippers.
SAC	Season high, his career high is 45.
SAC	Ya’ll should thank Antman’s baby for being born by halftime
SAC	That’s not his career high lol
MIN	Very stupid timberwolves team, lost my Acca
SAC	Way to go “KINGS!!” 👑🏀👏👍
SAC	He is the man  !
SAC	We need those damn clutch freethrows 👌!!!!!!
SAC	Congratulations💯💯💯
SAC	But The Winner for this match is 👶🏻🤍
SAC	He looks like Joel here
SAC	He scored 45pts last year, dummies
SAC	And then he’ll drop like 9 in the next game.
	😤 Yö Cael
	Michael Pay
	Scziian
	💜😊💜
SAC	Malik Monk vs Norman Powell for 6th Man of the Year
SAC	Thank you Kings sa paldo..😁
SAC	Monkman nice!!
SAC	6th man of the year!
SAC	He had 45 last year against the Clippers….come on NBA
SAC	Dude just ate us alive tonight!!
SAC	Chris Wenzel is town's always this dirty? Genuinely asking cause I don't watch the t wolves much but dude was kicking, kneeing elbowing etc
SAC	Joe Bou yeah he can be which is why he gets called for all these unnecessary fouls
SAC	Chris Wenzel I never thought of him like that. Crazy
MIN	Chris Wenzel ant is wild though man you guys have a star through and through
SAC	Joe Bou probably would’ve won if he played the entire game
SAC	Chris Wenzel it was competitive without fox but yeah. Missing 10 free-throws doesn't help
SAC	The wolves are a regular season team as it was clear from the beginning. Crash and burn come playoff time 👌🏽
SAC	He had 45 last year against the Clippers.come on NBA
SPAM	May god continue to bless Mr George Luke I never believe it's going to work out because I have lost a lot in different places I know one day they will face the judgement. I really appreciate you ✅ George Luke Riley
