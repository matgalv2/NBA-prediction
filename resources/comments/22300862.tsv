TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Yea you're  a great basketball  player I love to watch you play even with the lakers
	Ty Bauer I told you this kid is all buckets. I love his game.
	He had 45 last year against the Clippers….come on NBA
	Laker fan here, but Kings must work on their free throws during crunch time!
	Mel Yonaryo they work on them every single practice. But you can't emulate crunch time at practice.
	6TH MAN OF YEAR . Light the beam ! 🟣⚫️🟣⚫️🟣⚫️👑🦁
	Justin Ball Edward’s left that’s why wolves lost
	De’Aaron Fox didn’t play either
	He had 40+ last year against the Clippers.
	Great game Sacramento Kings! Malik you played with the heart! Love to see you play.
	Let’s face it, you saved the day again as you frequently do. But next time you have the ball with 7 seconds and the game is tied. Would you please drive towards the basket and either make the shot or get fouled and free throws. Other than that you’re a pretty entertaining player
	We’re just forgetting about the Kings-Clippers game last year where he scored 45? 😂
	Kings needed every one of those and the refs should be ashamed after that game. Elbows and kicks to the groin, head, chest, but yet nothing called when is the NBA gonna do something about officiating this year? Cause it blows! 💯
	Talk about catching a break, when Minnesota’s best player left half way through the game to see his baby being born. King’s definitely needed it.
	Greg Sandoval kings didn’t have fox and the kings have “zero” all stars and it was 8 vs 5 in favor for the wolves. Get outta here we Dawged up and clutched up.
	Michael-Robert Rizo and to be fair, Fox is a great player and without him, it probably was an easy win but Edward’s out, definitely evened the playing field.
	**Season-High** 39 points for Monk vs Wolves. Career-High was 45 points vs Clippers in 176-175 win via 2OT. Fox 42 points, Leonard 44 points.
	Congratulations MVP
	Another truly awesome performance by a player who is clearly the sixth man of the year and still ascending. Keep him!
	Malik Monk really that dude. He showed out when he was on the Lakers a few years back. He hasn't stopped since. One the best pieces to the Kings right now imo
	Emmanuel Harvey is he? Or is that he's a product of the structure of the NBA?
	Ry Guy nah
	Headline should be: Malik drops 35 in 2nd half to help secure victory against the West's top seed
	Chris Hankins without ANT in half time
	Iryne Pantilanan and De'aaron Fox all game
	Iryne Pantilanan Ya'll keep saying that but forget that Fox was out the whole game.
	Malik would be a starter anywhere in the league! But I'm happy he's my 6th man!
	The nba needs to be better his career high is 45
	I thougt his career high was 45?
	Erika Graham Loescher It is. NBA got get a new social media manager
	Erika Graham Loescher same
	There's my boy great job hun congrats to the whole team on that win on to the next game
	Must be looking for a new contract. Like most players act like playing about that time.
	The Kings r playing some fantastic🏀 I definitely enjoy watching them.
	kings is that team can beat any team hit or miss
	Swore he dropped 40 something last year with multiple clutch baskets
	Tutu Euv he did. NBA is slipping
	MOST UNDERRATED STAR IN THE NBA.🏀
	*Season High
	Most as a starter?
	Alexander Reynolds didn’t start.
	Danny McKevitt that wasn't monks career high, so I figured they meant starting vs off the bench
	Thought Udonis Haslem came out of retirement for a sec
	This isn't true. He scored over 40 last season and his buddy De'Aaron had over 40 in that same game again the Clippers.
	Season high, his career high is 45.
	Ya’ll should thank Antman’s baby for being born by halftime
	That’s not his career high lol
	Very stupid timberwolves team, lost my Acca
	Way to go “KINGS!!” 👑🏀👏👍
	He is the man  !
	We need those damn clutch freethrows 👌!!!!!!
	Congratulations💯💯💯
	But The Winner for this match is 👶🏻🤍
	He looks like Joel here
	He scored 45pts last year, dummies
	And then he’ll drop like 9 in the next game.
	😤 Yö Cael
	Michael Pay
	Scziian
	💜😊💜
	Malik Monk vs Norman Powell for 6th Man of the Year
	Thank you Kings sa paldo..😁
	Monkman nice!!
	6th man of the year!
	He had 45 last year against the Clippers….come on NBA
	Dude just ate us alive tonight!!
	Chris Wenzel is town's always this dirty? Genuinely asking cause I don't watch the t wolves much but dude was kicking, kneeing elbowing etc
	Joe Bou yeah he can be which is why he gets called for all these unnecessary fouls
	Chris Wenzel I never thought of him like that. Crazy
	Chris Wenzel ant is wild though man you guys have a star through and through
	Joe Bou probably would’ve won if he played the entire game
	Chris Wenzel it was competitive without fox but yeah. Missing 10 free-throws doesn't help
	The wolves are a regular season team as it was clear from the beginning. Crash and burn come playoff time 👌🏽
	He had 45 last year against the Clippers.come on NBA
	May god continue to bless Mr George Luke I never believe it's going to work out because I have lost a lot in different places I know one day they will face the judgement. I really appreciate you ✅ George Luke Riley
