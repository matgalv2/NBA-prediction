	Same team Miami just beat by 60, but 1 point is still a winm
	Shaun Perdue win is a win
	Shaun Perdue well...thats exactly why they played so hard thus game coupled with why they were overlooked. Magic had two double digit leads but didn't keep foot on the pedal. Especially up 9 with less than 2 minutes  to play
	Shaun Perdue  where’s Miami? In the standings. They obviously gonna play way harder the next night after getting their *** kicked
	Shaun Perdue  good take tho Shaun
	You could at least spell his name right… Wendell. Not Wendall.
	Bounce Back Blazers 😭
