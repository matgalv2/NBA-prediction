	Same team Miami just beat by 60, but 1 point is still a winm
	 win is a win
	 well...thats exactly why they played so hard thus game coupled with why they were overlooked. Magic had two double digit leads but didn't keep foot on the pedal. Especially up 9 with less than 2 minutes  to play
	  where’s Miami? In the standings. They obviously gonna play way harder the next night after getting their *** kicked
	  good take tho Shaun
	You could at least spell his name right… Wendell. Not Wendall.

	Yeah I think they’re going to pull the plug on Chauncey after the season ends.
	 F*cking hope so
	 Lol
	 how nd why? Portland sucks lol
	 Because the coaches job is to develop talent, run offensive and defensive schemes, and Chauncey has proven over the last 3 seasons that he is incapable of it. 🤷‍♂️ Tanking year or not, he's not doing the job well.
