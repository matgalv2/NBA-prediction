TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Cracked Boston. We will crack them in eastern finals.
	Love the win. Great game. Aint even mad i lost my parlay cause he dont pass the ball
	Just a warning to our Boston babies. We will crush in EC finals. No excuses please. Just prepare. And remember it's New York.
	Saihou Drammeh please- you’re 1/4 in the reg season and only won this because the Boston’s starters were throttling back
	How is he not mvp is crazy to me considering he carrying the team on his back with us missing 3 starters for a large portion of the season and the consist double teams and game planning against him
	Best player in the Eastern Conference and should be top 3 for MVP!
	i swear guys defending him forget that hes left handed 😆.
	Jeremy Fackrell  mamba mentality bro
	MVP deserved. Way more than anyone else
	Wow this is huge!!
	Chris Paynter 
	Worth every penny
	"Told yall what he would do in the NBA. ""Experts"" said he'd be a backup. Just what they said about Steph."
	NY is going to be the 2 seed in the east
	Last mite game was a given don't know why Boston just didn't play their bence the entire game..i'm a old baller 70yrs old dam I could have put up 20/7/5 😁
	Talks about Boston really didn’t care about winning this game lol they suited up so they played to win stop the nonsense, if 🧡💙 lost this game it would be Knicks aren’t ready for that team.. 🧡💙 will talk on the hardwood.
	Diane Allen Boston is 4-1 against the Knicks this season and the only one NY won was a game that meant literally nothing to Boston 
	🙂the team Boston faced is not the same team they played earlier in the season to bad Randall is out now.  The 🧡💙 is  different team.  We shall see def not counting out the 🧡💙
	Diane Allen they’re a different team from the beginning of the season but celtics beat them pretty easily about 6wks ago in MSG
	🤷🏽‍♀️
	Diane Allen Celtics weren’t at full strength then either
	🧡💙
	Dude is the truth.
	Alex Mohr that would be Paul pierce guy
	Mark Robbins I know what Paul Pierce’s nickname was. Lol
	he has a good wingman..
	Sucks that we got so many injuries, this could be a good year for us
	Ryan Hayes how is the weather over there
	Georgiette William rainy
	If we weren't winning so big he would've played the 4th quarter and gotten 50
	Imagine if he played with someone like Luka
	Dude is a Beast. Not a NY fan, but gotta give him props. Hope he is on the olympic team
	OG is back and now they're back to winning
	Boston threw the game
	New York Knicks Vs Boston Celtics
	Boston don't play defence non bearing gme

	He’s been amazing. Fantastic year.
	Jalen Brunson led the Knicks in scoring
	Would brunson be like this if he stayed in Dallas?
	Dude maybe the next point God.....sorry SGA.
	I didn’t think he would be as nice in the league.  I was wrong.
	This looks way closer than it was. Celtics were getting clapped by 30 before garbage time.
	LOVE to see this.
	How’s he not a superstar ?🙄 I’m so confused .
