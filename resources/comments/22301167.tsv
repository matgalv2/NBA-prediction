NYK	Love the win. Great game. Aint even mad i lost my parlay cause he dont pass the ball
BOS	Just a warning to our Boston babies. We will crush in EC finals. No excuses please. Just prepare. And remember it's New York.
NYK	Saihou Drammeh please- you’re 1/4 in the reg season and only won this because the Boston’s starters were throttling back
NYK	How is he not mvp is crazy to me considering he carrying the team on his back with us missing 3 starters for a large portion of the season and the consist double teams and game planning against him
NYK	Best player in the Eastern Conference and should be top 3 for MVP!
NYK	i swear guys defending him forget that hes left handed 😆.

NYK	"Told yall what he would do in the NBA. ""Experts"" said he'd be a backup. Just what they said about Steph."
NYK	NY is going to be the 2 seed in the east
	Last mite game was a given don't know why Boston just didn't play their bence the entire game..i'm a old baller 70yrs old dam I could have put up 20/7/5 😁
BOS	Talks about Boston really didn’t care about winning this game lol they suited up so they played to win stop the nonsense, if 🧡💙 lost this game it would be Knicks aren’t ready for that team.. 🧡💙 will talk on the hardwood.
NYK	Diane Allen Boston is 4-1 against the Knicks this season and the only one NY won was a game that meant literally nothing to Boston
NYK	🙂the team Boston faced is not the same team they played earlier in the season to bad Randall is out now.  The 🧡💙 is  different team.  We shall see def not counting out the 🧡💙

NYK	If we weren't winning so big he would've played the 4th quarter and gotten 50
