TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I think Denver intended to lose this game because they are afraid playing the Lakers in the first round.
	IMHO when a coach is tossed it’s because the refs know they effed up and don’t like getting called out. That call against KCP with George falling yeah right! My 6 year old does the same thing if he doesn’t get his way.
	The refs…I think it’s in their contracts that any L.A. team get “special treatment” against all other NBA teams. Am I wrong??
	Good job refs
	Nuggets avoiding #1 seed in order to get rid of Warriors who is poised to take the #8 seed after the play-in.
	Ronald Credo if the Nuggets are trying to avoid number one seed they would have Joker sitting out the rest of the season
	Isaac Nonay Nuggets have many chances to beat Clippers but they were playing not to win. It’s noticeable to this game.
	Nuggets will have a hard time beating Warriors should they want to be #1 and the latter ended up in #8 after the play-in. Unless, Lakers will tear off the Warriors in the play-in, then Nuggets can easily beat Lakers, in my opinion. That’s why Lakers is pushing hard to get into the #8 before the play-in starts.
	Denver need additional firepower. But Denver need to rest Playoff Jamal. since he injured his ankle at the start of the season. He has been on and off. But  bench need to step up have a killer instinct
	Thank u refs #ClipperNation
	Again very controversial refereeing by the clippers Nuggets game. Referees are arrogant, maybe more challenge options.
	Terrible refs! They don't even call a foul to that 3 point shot for Porter... Cooking show they help clippers to win!
	Refs get a game ball for that MVP performance.
	Did his 28 points lift the Clippers or was it the refs
	Nuggets vs clippers+refs
	Karen Sagang f kawhi played..this game would have been a blow out..nuggets no match against the clippers when healthy
	Player of the Game. Get it right NBA
	Nuggets without Murray have no secondary ball handler, whole game they were struggling. Allowed to many offensive rebounds as well...
	This must be the Westbrook effect
	Clippers Championship contender.
	Clippers are 0-100 in the playoffs
	Bro nuggets was up 17 n the game wouldn’t of been close if refs did they job stop crying n take this dub #nuggetsfans
	They played their best and won by 2
	Anybody but Denver!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
	Poor Joker needs some teammates..
	LeBron James
	Anything to avoid playing the lakers 😂
	win without khawi，nice game
	Sana Clippers vs. Denver 1st Round play'offs or Sun's vs. Denver
	Westbrook played well
	Am gonna retire in this city...what city is this?🫵🤣
	Would have been worse if we had kawhun
	Refs vs Denver
	The wives made a deal on this - Serbian connection Pavle Đorđe 😃
	Good win for them
	i ❤️ 8 ☺️
	This is a bad man !
	Refs were horrible  ….clippers got lucky tonight
	Great Win For The Clippers At Home
	L.A. Clippers needs to win 50 games and I’ll be happy
	Big win boss Jordan Paterson, with no Kawhi… best game PJ Tucker has had to date, good defensive… also like PG game… 
	Nick Burke 2nd in the West … Nuggets will be ok.
	The only thing that lifted them to victory was the horrible reffing. Absolutely horrible.
	Heck i switched to hockey when the Nuggets were up 25-8..it shows all these dummies claiming he is MVP that Joker cant win big games with Jamal Murray
	Desmond Anderson Not backing up Jokic but who´s then this mystery / solitary mvp winning by himself?
	😅
	Best player of the game for the clippers..
	I support Boston since i was a kid. But my 2nd best team are LA Clippers. They have great team: Paul George, Khawai Leonard, James Harden, Russ Westbrook, Ivica Zubac, Theis....
	His as as well as Jim Butler where n the hell are you guys all season
	Refs were helping
	Oh yeah😆👍 hey mr.deutschland my big boy warrior Mr.theis😎🤘 thanks to the advise of PG13😎👍
	The Los Angeles Clippers Robs the Denver Nuggets lol
	Denver Nuggets Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	And I just lost my ticket 😭
	Awtss I thought it's going to overtime 🤐
	Most overrated 💩 team in existence
	You mean Zu lifted them
	Final Clippers vs Celtics
	Paul George be on the lime
	Finally some LA team beat the Nuggets
	Jeff Morales twice this season
	VJ Valenciano so Clippers finally figured the Nuggets now?
	Jeff Morales i wish, they're tied at the regular season 2-2.
	Westbrook won it for clippers 🤣
	Big victory
	Lakers may move up a slot or two
	Matt D'occhio bloody good win with no Klaw
	It's a close win
	Nuggets in 4
	Thanks Bruce Brown 4 leaving i ❤️ it
	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	Many of the Nuggets games are won by small margins so once teams tighten defense in the 3rd and 4th quarters, the Nuggets will be very vulnerable.
	How many wins have the clippers had in June like all time? They’ve been around for 54 years 🤭
	Good job
	Lmao @ Clippers getting 7 more free throws.
	Some real biased refereeing in this one in favor of LA.
	sooo close
	Go Clippers!
	A bunch of Lakers fan crying. 🤣😅
	🤩 good game 👌👌💕
	Good one from em
	This is why I say joker is overrated, without Murray they will lose
	James Brooks cope
	Dimitrije Tucović did you mean to say cap
	This dude only show up when nobody cares
	Is this special?
	Hit me up let’s stack up 💪🏽💰💯

	😹🫵🏻
	❤️❤️❤️
	They better pray that they do not play the Clippers in the playoffs a few years ago the Clippers had them 3ti1 in the playoffs then Kawhi Leonard got hurt. I’m glad they’re being exposed. It’s going to be the clippers year.
	IMHO when a coach is tossed it’s because the refs know they effed up and don’t like getting called out. That call against KCP with George falling yeah right! My 6 year old does the same thing if he doesn’t get his way.
	1 rebound a quarter, great stat 🤦‍♂️
	Well done PG
	Nuggets fans 😭😭😭😭😭
	"Gifting 5 grands to the first five people to hit me up ""GOOD GOD "" Y'all stay blessed"
	Nice game
	Mop boy ftw
	Up the clips 🤍
	Paul George
