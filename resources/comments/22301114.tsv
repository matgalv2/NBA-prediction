TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DEN	I think Denver intended to lose this game because they are afraid playing the Lakers in the first round.
	IMHO when a coach is tossed it’s because the refs know they effed up and don’t like getting called out. That call against KCP with George falling yeah right! My 6 year old does the same thing if he doesn’t get his way.
LAC	The refs…I think it’s in their contracts that any L.A. team get “special treatment” against all other NBA teams. Am I wrong??
LAC	Good job refs
DEN	Nuggets avoiding #1 seed in order to get rid of Warriors who is poised to take the #8 seed after the play-in.
DEN	Ronald Credo if the Nuggets are trying to avoid number one seed they would have Joker sitting out the rest of the season
DEN	Isaac Nonay Nuggets have many chances to beat Clippers but they were playing not to win. It’s noticeable to this game.
	Nuggets will have a hard time beating Warriors should they want to be #1 and the latter ended up in #8 after the play-in. Unless, Lakers will tear off the Warriors in the play-in, then Nuggets can easily beat Lakers, in my opinion. That’s why Lakers is pushing hard to get into the #8 before the play-in starts.
DEN	Denver need additional firepower. But Denver need to rest Playoff Jamal. since he injured his ankle at the start of the season. He has been on and off. But  bench need to step up have a killer instinct
LAC	Thank u refs #ClipperNation
	Again very controversial refereeing by the clippers Nuggets game. Referees are arrogant, maybe more challenge options.
DEN	Terrible refs! They don't even call a foul to that 3 point shot for Porter... Cooking show they help clippers to win!
LAC	Refs get a game ball for that MVP performance.
LAC	Did his 28 points lift the Clippers or was it the refs
	Nuggets vs clippers+refs
	Karen Sagang f kawhi played..this game would have been a blow out..nuggets no match against the clippers when healthy
	Player of the Game. Get it right NBA
	Nuggets without Murray have no secondary ball handler, whole game they were struggling. Allowed to many offensive rebounds as well...
LAC	This must be the Westbrook effect
LAC	Clippers Championship contender.
LAC	Clippers are 0-100 in the playoffs
	Bro nuggets was up 17 n the game wouldn’t of been close if refs did they job stop crying n take this dub #nuggetsfans
LAC	They played their best and won by 2
	Anybody but Denver!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
DEN	Poor Joker needs some teammates..
	LeBron James
	Anything to avoid playing the lakers 😂
LAC	win without khawi，nice game
	Sana Clippers vs. Denver 1st Round play'offs or Sun's vs. Denver

LAC	This is a bad man !
LAC	Refs were horrible  ….clippers got lucky tonight
LAC	Great Win For The Clippers At Home
LAC	L.A. Clippers needs to win 50 games and I’ll be happy
	Big win boss Jordan Paterson, with no Kawhi… best game PJ Tucker has had to date, good defensive… also like PG game… 
	Nick Burke 2nd in the West … Nuggets will be ok.
LAC	The only thing that lifted them to victory was the horrible reffing. Absolutely horrible.
DEN	Heck i switched to hockey when the Nuggets were up 25-8..it shows all these dummies claiming he is MVP that Joker cant win big games with Jamal Murray
DEN	Desmond Anderson Not backing up Jokic but who´s then this mystery / solitary mvp winning by himself?
	😅
LAC	Best player of the game for the clippers..
LAC	I support Boston since i was a kid. But my 2nd best team are LA Clippers. They have great team: Paul George, Khawai Leonard, James Harden, Russ Westbrook, Ivica Zubac, Theis....
LAC	His as as well as Jim Butler where n the hell are you guys all season
LAC	Refs were helping
	Oh yeah😆👍 hey mr.deutschland my big boy warrior Mr.theis😎🤘 thanks to the advise of PG13😎👍
LAC	The Los Angeles Clippers Robs the Denver Nuggets lol

LAC	Westbrook won it for clippers 🤣
LAC	Big victory
LAC	Lakers may move up a slot or two
	Matt D'occhio bloody good win with no Klaw
LAC	It's a close win
DEN	Nuggets in 4
	Thanks Bruce Brown 4 leaving i ❤️ it
LAC	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
DEN	Many of the Nuggets games are won by small margins so once teams tighten defense in the 3rd and 4th quarters, the Nuggets will be very vulnerable.
	How many wins have the clippers had in June like all time? They’ve been around for 54 years 🤭
LAC	Good job
LAC	Lmao @ Clippers getting 7 more free throws.
LAC	Some real biased refereeing in this one in favor of LA.
LAC	sooo close
LAC	Go Clippers!
LAC	A bunch of Lakers fan crying. 🤣😅
LAC	🤩 good game 👌👌💕
LAC	Good one from em
DEN	This is why I say joker is overrated, without Murray they will lose

	❤️❤️❤️
DEN	They better pray that they do not play the Clippers in the playoffs a few years ago the Clippers had them 3ti1 in the playoffs then Kawhi Leonard got hurt. I’m glad they’re being exposed. It’s going to be the clippers year.
	IMHO when a coach is tossed it’s because the refs know they effed up and don’t like getting called out. That call against KCP with George falling yeah right! My 6 year old does the same thing if he doesn’t get his way.
LAC	1 rebound a quarter, great stat 🤦‍♂️
LAC	Well done PG
DEN	Nuggets fans 😭😭😭😭😭
SPAM	"Gifting 5 grands to the first five people to hit me up ""GOOD GOD "" Y'all stay blessed"
