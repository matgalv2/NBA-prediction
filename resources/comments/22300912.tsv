	Orlando Magic Vs New York Knicks
	Jalen Brunson
	now thats a good result, not those games like 130-120
	Nemanja Cvetinović sounds like someone is still upset about the kings beating the lakers 130-120
	Cody Faria i didnt even know that game happened, thanks for the information?
	Was defense actually played?
	Gino Valenzuela lol y'all complain about everything. Unless you're being sarcastic.
	Flacko Leeuw was saying i like it wasnt a 120+ point game...they actually played D it looks like...
	Gino Valenzuela yessir. Both teams played defense well, just one team played it better than the other. But a game in today’s NBA where neither team reaches 100? And one doesn’t even crack 80? It’s unheard of! 
	Jai Brinkofski i wish more games were like that and not 120+ everytime.
	In the 98-74 win of the New York Knicks, they dominated for a 24 point win against the Orlando Magic
	Knicks needed to beat this team  👏👏
	Rahn Garland they under estimate them the other times this time they took them nose to nose and didn't lose the lead like before
	Resume your winning ways KNICKS! 👏 ❤️
	I thought he was seriously injured
	LeBron KobeWade nope.
	Defense?
	🧡💙

	Go NY go Ny go!
	Diego Condino  is this an early 2000s game
	Very EASY win for the Knicks tonight. Magic aren’t a threat at all. The healthier this team gets,the easier it will become. Magic can’t play that song tonight.
	Michael William Cassidy The Magic beat the Knicks 3 out 4 games. 
	Willie Avant A fully healthy Knicks team is faaaaarrrrrr better than a fully healthy Disney Magic team and it’s not even close. Your team was almost fully healthy tonight minus Suggs,and the Knicks were missing 3 starters and still gave you that work. Very easy win for the Knicks,Magic weren’t ready for those bright lights in MSG they got punked.
	Michael William Cassidy The Magic beat the Knicks on that same court, with Paolo being the only starter. But of course you will ignore that.
	🤣💀. Knicks held the Magic to 74pts,that’s the lowest amount of points scored by a team this season my guy LOL HORRIBLE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Michael William Cassidy It still counts for 1 game.
	💀
	Michael William Cassidy The Chumps are your Knicks. The Magic will go farther in the playoffs, than the want to be, irrelevant Knicks.
	Willie Avant LOL delusional.
	Michael William Cassidy The Magic has 67 wins against the Knicks 63, in head to head games. Try to catch up , before talking trash about the Magic.
