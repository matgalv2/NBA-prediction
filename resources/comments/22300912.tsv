	Orlando Magic Vs New York Knicks
	Jalen Brunson
	now thats a good result, not those games like 130-120
	 sounds like someone is still upset about the kings beating the lakers 130-120
	 i didnt even know that game happened, thanks for the information?
	Was defense actually played?
	 lol y'all complain about everything. Unless you're being sarcastic.
	 was saying i like it wasnt a 120+ point game...they actually played D it looks like...
	 yessir. Both teams played defense well, just one team played it better than the other. But a game in today’s NBA where neither team reaches 100? And one doesn’t even crack 80? It’s unheard of! 
	 i wish more games were like that and not 120+ everytime.
	In the 98-74 win of the New York Knicks, they dominated for a 24 point win against the Orlando Magic
	Knicks needed to beat this team  👏👏
	 they under estimate them the other times this time they took them nose to nose and didn't lose the lead like before
	Resume your winning ways KNICKS! 👏 ❤️
	I thought he was seriously injured
	LeBron KobeWade nope.
	Defense?
	🧡💙
	Go NY go Ny go!
	
	  is this an early 2000s game
	Very EASY win for the Knicks tonight. Magic aren’t a threat at all. The healthier this team gets,the easier it will become. Magic can’t play that song tonight.
	 The Magic beat the Knicks 3 out 4 games. 
	 A fully healthy Knicks team is faaaaarrrrrr better than a fully healthy Disney Magic team and it’s not even close. Your team was almost fully healthy tonight minus Suggs,and the Knicks were missing 3 starters and still gave you that work. Very easy win for the Knicks,Magic weren’t ready for those bright lights in MSG they got punked.
	 The Magic beat the Knicks on that same court, with Paolo being the only starter. But of course you will ignore that.
	 You haven’t won a playoff series in 14 years,THAT’S PATHETIC. Your guy Franz was 6/20fg tonight AWFUL LOL 🤣💀. Knicks held the Magic to 74pts,that’s the lowest amount of points scored by a team this season my guy LOL HORRIBLE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 It still counts for 1 game.
	 Those are regular season games when the Knicks were injured,just goes to show how bad the Magic have been. Win a playoff series then chat,it’s been 14 years CHUMP ouchhhhhhh 💀
	 The Chumps are your Knicks. The Magic will go farther in the playoffs, than the want to be, irrelevant Knicks.
	 LOL delusional.
	 The Magic has 67 wins against the Knicks 63, in head to head games. Try to catch up , before talking trash about the Magic.
	 14 years without a single playoff series win OUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
	 The Knicks haven't won a title since 1973.
	 Horrible comeback. You haven’t won a playoff series in 14 years,you’ve been a lottery team so much I call the Magic Powerball LOL. It’s been a rough road for you guys the past 14 years LOL 💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 You speak of 14 years, but it's been 51 years for the KNICKS. 
	 By the way,your guy Paolo was 9/20fg tonight OUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. We had him locked up like Akon,EASY WORK.
	 Knicks won a playoff series last season bud,clearly you don’t watch basketball LOL. It’s been 14 years since the Magic have won a single playoff series OUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗽🗽🗽🗽
	 Says the guy who's team has a losing record against the Magic. 
	 Regular season wins against a team who was injured. Meanwhile you got embarrassed tonight,it wasn’t even competition 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 EASY WORK. 14 years without a playoff series win YIKES LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
	 Yall been injured all 130 games??67 to 63. Try to catch up.
	 Win a playoff series then chat bud,it’s been 14 years LOL 💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 I can chat now. The Magic is the Knicks big brother.
	 You’re delusional,it’s sad.
	 Apparently you don't know the meaning of delusional, with your comments. 
	 My guy…. It’s been “14 years” since you’ve won a playoff series be quiet LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😂
