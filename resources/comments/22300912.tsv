	Orlando Magic Vs New York Knicks
NYK	Jalen Brunson
NYK	now thats a good result, not those games like 130-120
NYK	Nemanja Cvetinović sounds like someone is still upset about the kings beating the lakers 130-120
	Cody Faria i didnt even know that game happened, thanks for the information?
ORL	Was defense actually played?
ORL	Gino Valenzuela lol y'all complain about everything. Unless you're being sarcastic.
ORL	Flacko Leeuw was saying i like it wasnt a 120+ point game...they actually played D it looks like...
ORL	Gino Valenzuela yessir. Both teams played defense well, just one team played it better than the other. But a game in today’s NBA where neither team reaches 100? And one doesn’t even crack 80? It’s unheard of!
	Jai Brinkofski i wish more games were like that and not 120+ everytime.
NYK	In the 98-74 win of the New York Knicks, they dominated for a 24 point win against the Orlando Magic
NYK	Knicks needed to beat this team  👏👏
NYK	Rahn Garland they under estimate them the other times this time they took them nose to nose and didn't lose the lead like before
NYK	Resume your winning ways KNICKS! 👏 ❤️
NYK	I thought he was seriously injured
	LeBron KobeWade nope.

	Christopher Stumpf
NYK	Go NY go Ny go!
	Diego Condino  is this an early 2000s game
NYK	Very EASY win for the Knicks tonight. Magic aren’t a threat at all. The healthier this team gets,the easier it will become. Magic can’t play that song tonight.
ORL	Michael William Cassidy The Magic beat the Knicks 3 out 4 games.
NYK	Willie Avant A fully healthy Knicks team is faaaaarrrrrr better than a fully healthy Disney Magic team and it’s not even close. Your team was almost fully healthy tonight minus Suggs,and the Knicks were missing 3 starters and still gave you that work. Very easy win for the Knicks,Magic weren’t ready for those bright lights in MSG they got punked.
ORL	Michael William Cassidy The Magic beat the Knicks on that same court, with Paolo being the only starter. But of course you will ignore that.
NYK	🤣💀. Knicks held the Magic to 74pts,that’s the lowest amount of points scored by a team this season my guy LOL HORRIBLE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
NYK	Michael William Cassidy It still counts for 1 game.

NYK	Michael William Cassidy The Chumps are your Knicks. The Magic will go farther in the playoffs, than the want to be, irrelevant Knicks.
