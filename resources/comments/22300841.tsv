	SGA again! Dude's amazing
	All I see is this dude scoring 31 points every night 😭
	Daniel Hedima very easy for him to put that numbers in very efficient way
	Daniel Hedima 10th 31-point game lmao
	Daniel Hedima and plenty of assists as well
	MVP of this season without a question. Only close opponent is Jokic.
	MVP...
	Jason Melanio 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐩👍👍

	MVP!
	Gonna pick this guy over Ja. 💪💪💪
	Edward Matriano Capistrano ja's better
	You're dreaming.
	SGA, shoot first everything else second. Great player for sure, but for the playoffs time will tell
	NBA- with your agreement to 2k you are allowing them to, 
	He won’t win mvp cause he’s black and the stat padder will get it smh ! If it was luka on this team forget it lol 😂
	Lucas Dagnone luka leads him in every major category goofy
	Jeffrey Carter luka needs a ring not stats
	Lucas Dagnone rings are a team accomplishment not an individual accomplishment
	Lucas Dagnone why does skin color matter?
	Zander Flores to me it doesn’t but if him and doncic were flipped he’d be number one. Just like how the nfl rigged it for the chiefs lol
	The Lip💋 strike again
	They can beat any teams... Any teams can beat them too... 40% chance they can make it to the finals I think 🤔💬
	SGA 30 points Per game is consistent 😳😳
	Way to go Thunder ⛈️ up guys  MVP SGA
	See you in the playoffs firstround 💪
	Aicho Duarte 🤣🤣🤣that squad of has beens along with Curry will be lucky to make the playoffs and even if so it'll just end up 3-1 like this seasons series.
	MVP perhaps?
	Shai is always score 31 😲
	Sga deserve MVP
	Está on fire 🔥
	MVP
	⚡🆙 👌
	🧡🤍🩵
	Grabe talaga si Shai easy lang sa kanya ang 30pts per game
	Give SGA his MVP already
	Thunder Up! ⚡️⚡️
	That's good of you 😊
	Houston Rockets Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
	Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
	"filipino bandwagon fans that keep commenting ""first round exit/second round exit"" in these NBA pages are just jealous to the top teams because their favorite teams are SH*T"
	Roy Butler of course if they meet the lakers in first round as expected 
	Roy Butler 😅😅😅 mind ur own business. Let them comment what they want to say😅
	Roy Butler their favorite teams are the Lakers and Warriors. Those are the only teams they know. Oh and the only names of nba players they know is Lebron James and Stephen Curry.
	Clippers will regret trading him until he retires 🤭
	David Dobbs playoffs that matter 
	Aicho Duarte have to win enough games to make the play offs
	David Dobbs yes but you said clippers regreting by trading sga 
	Aicho Duarte you need young talent too so they can develop under the vets.
	Aicho Duarte so what exactly has the clippers done in the playoffs since they traded SGA? Especially that makes the clippers not regret trading him, a lot of people said that the clippers won that trade yet even with the rosters they had over the few years they still haven't even been to the finals
	Will Watson just wait 2024 L.A. Clippers championship are coming your to much excited 🔥🔥🏆
	Aicho Duarte Sam Presti has built a squad that will compete for titles for the foreseeable future and they still have a truckload of first round picks coming up
	So he's not a MVP yet with those numbers? and I'm God lol
	Thunder are on fire. Wonder if they will surpass the playoffs
	That’s awesome 🤩
