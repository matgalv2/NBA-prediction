TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	CONGRATS BUCKS KEEP IT UP NICE GAME ITS WAS DAME TIME ONE THE GREATEST 3 POINTERS IN NBA GOD BLESS NBA ALWAYS PEACE😉👍👏👌🙏🏻✌💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
	The Bucks are in a position where any team that comes to compete with them in the playoffs could potentially defeat the Bucks in the first round.
	Layla Luna  well at least other teams will get a warm up period for round two
	Layla Luna mao ba teh?
	Layla Luna all due to Lillard's lack of defense. There's a reason why Portland never went anywhere
	Ryan Evan lillards defense in this game is what sealed the deal.
	Eliza Schaeffer his defense this year is at the bottom for guards. He is a 118.3
	Ryan Evan One of the most overrated..a bad version of Curry
	Eliza Schaeffer he didn’t do anything nets were coughing the ball up cuz they auck, but look at that giannis played must’ve been scared of Boston the night before, now I know for sure I’m not worried about Milwaukee. Barely beat Brooklyn and blew a 20 point lead lol
	Amazing that Giannis can have a hamstring issue against the Celtics, but can recover the next night.
	Matt Simpson mind games
	Matt Simpson I've done so it's possible
	Bryant Serrano what a hero
	Matt Simpson thanks bro
	Matt Simpson he not fully recovered
	Matt Simpson he missed two games before this game
	Funny how y'all had a healthy roster for the night and we only lost by 3 without one of our starters...but do keep talking. It's all you Boston fans know how to do.
	Jesse Jonas it wasn’t a healthy roster though so nice try, no holiday or hauser those are 2 dudes who can give u 30 so evens out. Boston led by 20 most of the game and had a bad 4-5 minutes in the 4th because Milwaukee got hot from 3. game wasn’t as close as the final score suggested. Lol
	🙄.  And neither team was healthy so 🤷
	Matt Simpson don’t give him that Embiid treatment lol
	Matt Simpson scared of what last time he played against em we made em wave the white flag before 2nd half started lol
	Matt Simpson He did not play against the Suns on sunday too. Be fr.
	Matt Simpson  Yeah just like it's amazing that you're going bald and can't expect it
	greatest shooter ever he change the game of basketball
	🤣
	Monica Torres were talking about Damian Lillard you know that right?
	Monica Torres Hhahaha
	Monica Torres and Lillard in the same sentence for some weird reason
	Monica Torres He's a career 43% shooter and and 37% from deep. Nothing to write home about in terms of actual shooting. He's just popular for taking extremely bad shots early in the shot clock that sometimes go in.
	Josh Bryant is that how you feel about Steph?  They have almost the exact same career stats all the way around.
	Michelle Rogers Curry shoots almost 43% for his career from 3 and over 47% combined for his career. Not the same. Shooting nearly 43% from 3 for your career is elite. 37% is average. 43% is elite.
	Michelle Rogers not even close.
	This game should have been a blow out by the bucks 
	Scooter Lopo Hello dear I'm Sandra from UK , I need someone who I can talk to her please
	DAME!!❤🏀🔥🔥🔥
	讚~
	All these people talk on Dame hes a beast
	NBA refs, worst officiating in professional sports...either that or they got money on the games...I'm a Suns fan...
	Brooklyn Nets Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	I want to thank the Bucks for getting Lillard. It allowed the Celtics to build the most dominant team since the Curry/Durant Warriors
	Where is his ring lol
	Todd A. Norin where’s yours?
	Todd A. Norin Not every good player do have a ring... Did you just started to watch NBA yesterday?
	Todd A. Norin
	Carmelo, Iverson, Stockton, Nash  to name a few, got no rings either!
	🤣🤣🤣 tf a Ring gotta do with anything
	Dude has been on a mission after all star 💫 locked In
	He has won a lot of honors for the team.
	Big Deal look who you played. Play a Contender
	Love the game
	Let's go Bucks 🦌 🦌 🦌 🔥
	Wow, the hustle in this shot is incredible! 🏀 Keep ballin' out there! 🙌
	What an accomplishment! WOW lol
	Put some respect On my Name 💯
	Will Michael Jordan's all-time best be surpassed?
	Love watching Dame take over the game.
	Bucks a 1st round exit
	That’s how we do it from the TOWN 🏀 congratulations
	💯Bucks❤
	Lillards been a monster after all star break Joe Wegerbauer

	greatest shooter ever he change the game of basketball
	Sarah James Scott who???
	He has won a lot of honors for the team.🏀
	👀
	Greek freak week it ain’t about how many rebounds and points you put up but how many games you win and they can’t beat Boston with or without Giannis so they are a washed up team playoffs yeah they in watch the clippers put them out or golden state it’s gonna be a weak team that put them out tru gone it no more championship team bucks are done Giannis need to find a winning team
	Well Done Bucks!!
	Hottie 👍❤️
	Congratulations
	The trio of Portis, Beverly, and Thanasis created imbalance in NBA.
	That boy Dame is a menace 🔥
	Love the bucks
	Lillard needs to be the team leader not Giannis
	Pray 2024 belongs to GOD and the Bucks 🙏 AMEN !

	so 30 points is considered taking over? nba celebrates for ANY STAT now a days. 30 points? in 48 mins? lmaooooo that’s like 7 points a quarter. 3 baskets a quarter is good in the nba?
	Orlando J Rodriguez he literally had 13 points in the four quarter. Read the stats.
	Maria Nicole Plus 2 steals in the last 2 or so minutes. As well as a 3 and a tough pull-up midrange in that time. So, yeah, taking over in the closing minutes is accurate.
	Paul Smaglik heck yeah!! Dude was balling out in clutch time!!
	Orlando J Rodriguez yea
	Orlando J Rodriguez over 48 minutes? You think Lillard didn't rest and played every second of the game? He had 30 and 12 and took over in the clutch to secure the win. Stat wise, he also had the best stats out of everyone be it his team or the enemy te… Wyświetl więcej
	😏
	Temitope back to back steals at the end of the game?  He was playing pretty good D last night.
	Thanasis didn't even play. Imagine how much worse the beat down would've been.
	Wow they beat a bottom feeder, kudos 👏🏼

	Things are tough especially this time of the year so l'm gifting 8 grands to the first 10 people to message me with
	"A supportive message for those in our state dealing with tax or bill issues – chime in with a ""GOD DID,"" and the first four responders might just find a boost of 5 grands coming their way!"
	Ima laugh when the Bucks sprint through to the finals
