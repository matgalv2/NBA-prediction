	greatest shooter ever he change the game of basketball
	Amazing that Giannis can have a hamstring issue against the Celtics, but can recover the next night.
	The Bucks are in a position where any team that comes to compete with them in the playoffs could potentially defeat the Bucks in the first round.
	This game should have been a blow out by the bucks 
	DAME!!❤🏀🔥🔥🔥
	All these people talk on Dame hes a beast
	He has won a lot of honors for the team.
	I want to thank the Bucks for getting Lillard. It allowed the Celtics to build the most dominant team since the Curry/Durant Warriors
	Ryan Evan and us  peeps know what Dame is capable of.  Next person that says he can't play D, should watch this game.
	 he is great offensively, and that used to outweigh his defensive struggles, but come playoff time his defensive faults are why the lost. He can hit all the buzzer beaters he wants, but defense wins.
	" what did I say, that was untrue?  Maybe the haters should make sure to say ""in Portland"", before they say his D sucks... my comments are based on what he IS actually doing, not from pdx."
	Love the game
	Love watching Dame take over the game.
	Let's go Bucks 🦌 🦌 🦌 🔥
	Wow, the hustle in this shot is incredible! 🏀 Keep ballin' out there! 🙌
	Will Michael Jordan's all-time best be surpassed?
	Put some respect On my Name 💯

	Well
	❤️🤍🖤💚

	The trio of Portis, Beverly, and Thanasis created imbalance in NBA.
	Dame time ⌚that's wassup!
	Love the bucks
	Pray 2024 belongs to GOD and the Bucks 🙏 AMEN !
	so 30 points is considered taking over? nba celebrates for ANY STAT now a days. 30 points? in 48 mins? lmaooooo that’s like 7 points a quarter. 3 baskets a quarter is good in the nba?
	Thanasis didn't even play. Imagine how much worse the beat down would've been.
