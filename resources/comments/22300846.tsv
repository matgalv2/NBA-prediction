	Lose to the pistons but beat the cavs 😂how’s that make sense
	Oleg Burduzha It doesn't. And that's how the sportsbooks continue to make billions. 😄
	Oleg Burduzha Hey my Cavs beat Mavericks, Clippers etc but couldn’t beat the Bulls this time. That’s the way the ball bounces!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Terrie Lynn Damron Hillyer no that just shows the cavs can lose to anyone. Not championship bound.
	Oleg Burduzha Any team can lose to any team. Evidently you don’t know that!!!  Whoever thought the Heat would make the finals! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Terrie Lynn Damron Hillyer yea but everyone knew they was finna lose
	Oleg Burduzha Cuz we're a wildly inconsistent team with wild inconsistent line ups and wildly inconsistent players regardless of whos actually out there
	Marcel Jamar McFadden I know you’re not a Cavs fan but truly you are smart ass! 🤣
	Woohoo! Imma see you next Thursday! I cannot wait!!! Bulls baby!!

	Yep the Bulls just needed Cleveland to come to town for that W. Detroit just too much for them.
	Arik E Zaleski hello how are you doing today am Rita and you
	Demar And Andre And Vic And Someone off The Bench Score Some Points And Grab Some Rebounds And Assists Bulls Win Some Basketball
	I’ve been watching NBA videos 24/7 since the 1940s and I’ve seen enough. The only reason that you consider Michael Jordan as your GOAT is if you hit your head as a kid and your brain suffered a factory reset. 
	Johnny Wang 🖕🏽troll
	Johnny Wang so you are just as old as Joe biden?
	Mention Drummond please
	U Beat Mavs and exhausted yourselves.

	DeMar DeRozan
	MY FAVORITE TEAM DA BULLS
	Este juego que está reñido se fue a segundo overtime pero con ese 2 y último largo overtime los bulls le sacaron ventaja de 9 a los Cavs para ganar el juego con un DeMar DeRozan modo no quiero saber de nada en ese 2 overtime encesto 11 puntos en ese 2 … Wyświetl więcej

	Where's strus at 🤣 garbage ahh one lucky night and Cavs act like they won a championship meanwhile they can't beat the bulls
	Ramirez Ramirez whatever! Meanwhile the Cavs  beat the Mavericks, the Clippers What do you have against the Cavs? You’re always putting them down! Just like last night. Your name is not a hard one to forget! 😁 Jealous I take it. This isn’t the first time you talked about them. I see your following  them! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Terrie Lynn Damron Hillyer can't even beat the 6ers 😂 doubt they will get far in play offs and doubt they can beat Mavs in a 7 game series 🤣 Cavs only hope now is to get Lebronze back to stop the drought
