TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
MIL	I'm beginning to think there's a lot of 'Match Fixing' in the NBA. Bucks ordinarily wouldn't lose to Raptors. There's something they're not telling us 😆
MIL	I hope they pay for getting rid of that coach
TOR	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
TOR	I think GTJ is building his resume.  Whatever the reason, it was a good game.
MIL	Their losing streak was intentionally because they don't want to face Miami Heat this upcoming playoffs Doc River's Mindset 😂🤣
TOR	And the Raptors had lost 15 straight games going into tonight's game.
MIL	Bucks trying hard to avoid facing the Heat😂
MIL	Dame can't be only man out there hustling all other bucks aren't scoring rebounds the big man ain't crashing boards 💯 that's ight I believe in playoff dame the problem looks like coaching to me gil arenas does make some valuable points great game dame win loss I'm dame fan forlife he's main reason I started watching the bucks
MIL	Wolves beat the same raptors 3 days ago by 48? Now bucks lose ? Time to open a case on this one lol
