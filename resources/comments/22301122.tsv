TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I'm beginning to think there's a lot of 'Match Fixing' in the NBA. Bucks ordinarily wouldn't lose to Raptors. There's something they're not telling us 😆 
	I hope they pay for getting rid of that coach
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	I think GTJ is building his resume.  Whatever the reason, it was a good game.
	Their losing streak was intentionally because they don't want to face Miami Heat this upcoming playoffs Doc River's Mindset 😂🤣
	And the Raptors had lost 15 straight games going into tonight's game.
	Bucks trying hard to avoid facing the Heat😂
	Dame can't be only man out there hustling all other bucks aren't scoring rebounds the big man ain't crashing boards 💯 that's ight I believe in playoff dame the problem looks like coaching to me gil arenas does make some valuable points great game dame win loss I'm dame fan forlife he's main reason I started watching the bucks
	Wolves beat the same raptors 3 days ago by 48? Now bucks lose ? Time to open a case on this one lol
	Where is rest team man Bobby Portis been just standing there all good dame always shows up godbless you family dame
	I'm a raps fan but they gotta investigate this bucks loss
	Mind you; the Raptors just playin for fun 😁
	Doc Rivers in playoffs form already losing 3 games in a row against bottom feeder teams 😂 🤣

	They going to lose because they got rid of their coach and got washed up Doc…. Imagine if Doc was the coach for the whole season…. They wouldn’t even be in the number 2 spot in the east….

	Doc Rivers. Well alright then. The road to the Eastern Conference finals goes through the 2 seed
	The Bucks losing to the 3 worse teams in the NBA back to back to back is wild lol.
	looks like bucks wants that 3rd spot to have a duel with the pacers right away in the first round. 😅

	Bucks are in a low right now. Imagine losing to the 15 game losing streak Raptors who are trying so hard to tank.
	It's over

	Are the Bucks really trying to lose on purpose? 🤔
	Gary was on a mission to get a win, with 31 points tonight! 👏🏻👍🏻❤️😍

	Believe me but Doc Rivers is a GOATEE coach. The way he make the bucks tank without getting dismissed is phenomenal.
	No fear of the Deer, from the Raptors.
