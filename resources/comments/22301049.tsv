	Much needed back to back wins Boyz 🔵🟡🔵🟡🙌🙌🏀🏀
	Come on. Wiggins should have been on this. Curry struggled tonight. 😕
	 blame the NBA’s editor 😂don’t blame on Curry
	Abs da best player in da game right now, 🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝 amazing Curry for lifeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee…..
	Magic are going home in the 1st round.
	It’s a fact: you crossed the bridge of a team with better record than yours, so please be quiet! That’s something to be cheerful about, magical folks!
	Hope gsw will continue its winning streak. With wiggins in his old playing prowess, gsw will be a team to reckon with.
	If LeBron would have had under 20 it would have been a hate train on here. Smhhh
	Wiggins got robbed of the finals MVP! and of this game's MVP!
	They play better without Green. Facts
	Come On, Wiggins should be on the photo, not the emotional side kick!
	The Dubs need to play the rest of their games on the road....great back to back wins....without Dray tonight.....Wiggins stepped up huge....
	Wiggins rocked tonight💙💛
	Banchero make a three point shot when they are down only 1 with 3mins remaining in the 4th Q. Lol
	I wish they could play the rest of the season on the road.
