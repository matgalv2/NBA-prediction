TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Much needed back to back wins Boyz 🔵🟡🔵🟡🙌🙌🏀🏀
	Come on. Wiggins should have been on this. Curry struggled tonight. 😕
	🤣🤣🤣 yall don't need to worry about the lakers now more like the rockets 🤣🤣🤣
	Kristopher Fogg I don’t know why you think the lakers all that like hush your mouth
	🤣
	Kristopher Fogg first off we came back and beat the lakers more than once so keep watching basketball unless you probably don’t watch it all
	Kristopher Fogg just want attention put yourself on the hush mode
	Vũ Hoàng Long he had a double double
	😂don’t blame on Curry
	Vũ Hoàng Long so what’s your point they worked as a team so hush
	Abs da best player in da game right now, 🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝 amazing Curry for lifeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee…..
	Magic are going home in the 1st round.
	Michael William Cassidy Warriors stacked with all stars….Magic are all young and we’re finally excited about our team…even if they don’t make it past first round. Warriors should not be struggling to make playoffs sadly!
	It’s a fact: you crossed the bridge of a team with better record than yours, so please be quiet! That’s something to be cheerful about, magical folks!
	Hope gsw will continue its winning streak. With wiggins in his old playing prowess, gsw will be a team to reckon with.
	If LeBron would have had under 20 it would have been a hate train on here. Smhhh
	Wiggins got robbed of the finals MVP! and of this game's MVP!
	Jo Ker There's no Wiggins in the finals if it wasn't for Stephen Curry .
	Jo Ker lol got robbed . You sure of that? Curry carried them in a must win in  game 3 with 40+ points.  Then curry was very consistent during the finals you just a hater. Put curry out for the rest of the game. Then the warriors are like gleague players.
	Jo Ker nice name
	Jo Ker why because of 6 extra points?? 😂 Steph has 10 assists to Wiggins 1 and almost scored the same amount of points 😂
	Jo Ker were you dropped in the head when you were a baby?
	They play better without Green. Facts
	Jasper Calibuso lol. You don't know what you're saying
	Come On, Wiggins should be on the photo, not the emotional side kick!
	Ignoramus
	Jo Ker they should put your mama’s pic
	Jo Ker don't tell me a joke
	Wiggins rocked tonight💙💛
	The Dubs need to play the rest of their games on the road....great back to back wins....without Dray tonight.....Wiggins stepped up huge....
	Banchero make a three point shot when they are down only 1 with 3mins remaining in the 4th Q. Lol
	Awesome Warriors Congratulations Fantastic Win well done Team👍👏
	I wish they could play the rest of the season on the road.

	CONGRATS
	Stephen Curry
	Green did it again. He can't play a single NBA match without exploding. I blame GSW team as well. No one comes to him to calm him down. They stay quiet and watch him explode, all the time.
	SC💛🖤
	PLAYOFF WIGGS IS ACTIVATED😤😤
	Rockets not helping the Dubs out at all....going to be tight
	Oh boy! Why is Wiggins so underrated? The boy issa star!
	17 points 🤣🤣🤣
	Still not contenders lol
