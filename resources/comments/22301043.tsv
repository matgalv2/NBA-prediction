	If the Clippers got 40+ free throw attempts, they had a chance to win
	As a Pacer fan, I’m glad we managed to not lose 2 in a row on a back to back. Good dub. Please for the love of Odin avoid the play-in.
	Peyton Bradley. Must have different refs  or maybe the Clippers are firmly in the playoffs and the NBA told the refs not to interfere like last night.
	Jimmy Smith I’ll take it at this point
	My team is bored. Let’s get the regular season done and over with already.
	I really like this Pacer Team they are fun to watch
	Good game CHIPPERS
	Since PS43 went to pacers they are rocking now.! 🙂‍↔️
	Great Win Pacers 👏🏀🏀
	Clippers trying to position themselves for favorable matchups in playoffs
	But LeBron James is the greatest of all time 👑🐐💪
	It would be nice if Carlisle let Halliburton play the same amount of minutes
	Nice to see Pascal beating up Kawhi...
	I swear whenever teams come to LA they always lose the first game and win the second 😂
	🤣
	😂😭starting to think the nba gods are real
	That team has a lot of talent and a brilliant coach.
	Wow in the same arena as last night. Tonight both teams shot the same amount of Free Throws 
	😂😂😂 baby LA played focus on them
	Dre Steph. And the NBA/REFS helped them with that focus.
	❤️❤️
	David Mary   You have my permission to keep on looking.
	Pacers are a high scoring team, that's why the Lakers had to put up 150 pts just to get a win the previous night. Clippers have some issues going down the stretch.
	Ronald C Maiden Sr clippers are already tired they are waiting for playoff
	Clippers are Horrible! This team keeps losing, as a huge favorite 🔥 🗑
	Clippers are trying to avoid matching up certain teams in the second round. They got 3 stars and a half and they still scared. 😂
	Clippers not going far… kawhi is the team but harden 😂😂😂 should have started Westbrook over harden to be honest not that it’ll make a difference but still
	the odds are favoring our Lakers
	What is going on with the Clippers?
	Patricia Howse old age mix with big perk curse
