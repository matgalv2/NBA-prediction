	If the Clippers got 40+ free throw attempts, they had a chance to win
	As a Pacer fan, I’m glad we managed to not lose 2 in a row on a back to back. Good dub. Please for the love of Odin avoid the play-in.
	. Must have different refs  or maybe the Clippers are firmly in the playoffs and the NBA told the refs not to interfere like last night.
	 I’ll take it at this point
	My team is bored. Let’s get the regular season done and over with already.
	I really like this Pacer Team they are fun to watch
	Good game CHIPPERS
	Since PS43 went to pacers they are rocking now.! <span class=
	Great Win Pacers 👏🏀🏀
	Clippers trying to position themselves for favorable matchups in playoffs
	But LeBron James is the greatest of all time 👑🐐💪
	Nice to see Pascal beating up Kawhi...
	It would be nice if Carlisle let Halliburton play the same amount of minutes
	I swear whenever teams come to LA they always lose the first game and win the second 😂
	 Yep, the Lakers are taking care of business. But the clippers not so much 🤣
	 and like a month ago it was the other way around 😂😭starting to think the nba gods are real
	That team has a lot of talent and a brilliant coach.
	Wow in the same arena as last night. Tonight both teams shot the same amount of Free Throws 
	 it’s funny yall love to throw shots at lakers even though they ain’t playing 😂😂😂 baby LA played focus on them
	. And the NBA/REFS helped them with that focus.
	" I am really looking for a man whose completely honest and sincere about his words and feelings. A man who is ready for a long term relationship and ready to build up a family with someone real and honest as caring as i am. A marriage minded… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	   You have my permission to keep on looking.
	Pacers are a high scoring team, that's why the Lakers had to put up 150 pts just to get a win the previous night. Clippers have some issues going down the stretch.
	 clippers are already tired they are waiting for playoff
	Clippers are trying to avoid matching up certain teams in the second round. They got 3 stars and a half and they still scared. 😂
	Clippers not going far… kawhi is the team but harden 😂😂😂 should have started Westbrook over harden to be honest not that it’ll make a difference but still
	the odds are favoring our Lakers
	Clippers are Horrible! This team keeps losing, as a huge favorite 🔥 🗑
	What is going on with the Clippers?
	 old age mix with big perk curse
	Clippers ready for the Playoffs!
	Too good by the Pacers, darn
	Kawhi harden  paul George Westbrook zubac ..superstar at team😁
