TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Sometimes some teams get beat down really bad and u sitting there wondering like: 
	 Sacramento had done well against Dallas this year. That was before PJ and Gafford got here. Totally different team now. It’s going to be a fun playoff.
	
	I'm from Houston ...but I love Lukas energy...keep winning my guy
	 if you're a Rockets fan, I'm rooting for y'all to steal that 10 playin spot! Should be a fun game Sunday.
	 much love bruhhh
	 y'all got a tough one tonight. Get the dub!
	 both teams killing it this year
	Remember last season when everyone said Luka and Kyrie couldn’t play together?
	Absolutely a huge win for the MAVS
	No Doubt! MVP
	Compared to his usual stat line, this was a chill day
	It was a close game!
	Luka and Kyrie are finally synchronized..it's a beautiful thing 🤷🏽...I just hope they're not peaking to soon..
	As a mavs fan I feel kinda embarrassed for thinking this game was gonna be anywhere near close to each other
	Dallas coming for the 4th seed
	Doing all this without playing the 4th quarter 💪
	Even Jokic said he's the MVP
	If the Mavs catch up to 4th, Luka has to be the MVP.
	 nope
	 yup
	This team has great chemistry. Kyrie looks happy and  Luka gonna win MVP this year! Let’s goooo Mavs!
	2024 champion los angeles Lakers 💜💛🏆
	Lets aim 5th seed!!! Then maybe the NBA would start putting Luka next to Jokic in the MVP race!
	Luka should definitely get MVP this year. He should have at least 2 by now.
	Didn't even play the 4th quarter either 😍
	Took the whole 4th quarter off.
	We took 2 in Dallas and now they got us at home, we gotta bounce back Friday! 
	Gafford and PJ are good additions but Kings played poorly last night, Expect them to come out with more intensity and urgency.
	 I'll revisit later
	Bet I’ll be here.
	 it's gonna be an interesting game for sure! But I still think the Mavs will get it done. But I think it'll be much closer this time around. Mavs are like a different team since the trade!

	"Great team win tonight 43-29 Dallas Mavericks against the 42-20 Sacramento Kings and now we take sole position of 6 place in.The west alright we got to bring that’s same mentality mindset to come out and be aggressive dominate hunger toughness resiliency angry mentality mindset to go out and set .The tone to let’s them we coming and we be stop for 48 minutes for 4 quarters from the opening tip down at Golden One Center on NBA TV at 9:00pm with the MFFL to bring.Thats rowiness loudest proudest roaring noises passion to affect there players and making our players feel our presence and making it our house in there place and have playoffs type of atmosphere on Friday night with 12,000 screaming fans LETS GO MAVS"". Fans alright.On the offensive end of the court get out in transition and run with pace and have that’s ball hoping from side to side and attack there players all game long on the defensive side play lock down together defense and get in front of there best players and affect there shots selection all game long like Kobe would job not finish let’s put this team out there misery on Friday night and make it 6 in row we can’t afford to take our foot of the gas let’s stomp on there throats from the opening tip and go out there and make a statement there we are for real alright on Friday night we got another massive game down there let’s goo out there and play our game for 48 minutes from the opening tip!!"
	Too much scoring by Luka and Kyrie. How the other players gonna be ready later on if they don't feed them the ball instead of shooting, especially with that margin of victory?! Smdh. NOT GONE MAKE IT OUT THE WEST!
	 did you even watch the game?!
	 no. This is a general statement if the Mavs gameplan every game. Do you understand my point? If so, agree or give me a counter point.
	" well if you watch the games, you'd see a lot of passing is going on. Gotta remember, you don't get the assist unless your teammate makes the basket. Which is why I asked if you watch the games...because the statement makes no sense.

	" I disagree. There is no such stat as ""Assists received but not turned into a basket"" So that premise holds no water. It's just assist. If you dont make a basket, it's a missed field goal, NOT ""Your teammate didn't make the basket from you… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 I never said that Stat exists 🤷‍♀️. My point is that he does pass the ball but the person he passes to doesn't always make the shot. You're trying to say he doesn't pass. But you also don't watch the games so don't see all the passing going on. And he's not always the one who brings in the ball either. Like many people, I think you may just look at stats on a screen and judge from that instead of actually watching games and seeing what does happen. And once again, he didn't even play the 4th quarter. He scored all but 2 of those points in the first half. So it makes no sense to say he's not passing. And sometimes he passes and then that person passes it as well. It's hard to judge a game/player by stats only. You gotta actually watch the game.
	And didn’t even play the 4th quarter
	MVP and it's not close, don't @ me.
	What's up with the kings and clippers smh
	Joker winning the MVP in a runaway race.
	Luca Magic
	Standing is very beautiful to the eyes...
	Luka is always on them charts
	Magic ✨🥂
	 friendly game?
	It is okay if Lakers have to meet the Kings in playIn, they have no right to play a series if they can't defeat the Kings in knockouts!
	Those number in just 3 quarters
	And 3 or 4 steals 🥵
	Lion sleeps tonight. 🤔😎✌️👊❤️
	thats your #5 in the MVP ranking- nba voters. clowns
	Luka Dončić taught me how to spell his name. 😂
	How many strikes dose Draymond Green get before he gets kicked out of the league?
	Dallas vs Kings???
	2Ki 12:18 Then Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had given to the Lord, together with the things he himself had given, and all the gold in the Temple store and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael, king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem.
