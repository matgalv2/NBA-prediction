TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	Sometimes some teams get beat down really bad and u sitting there wondering like:
DAL	GHALIL EINSTEIN did you see Mavs Defense this game? they were phenomenal
	GHALIL EINSTEIN ulol
	GHALIL EINSTEIN how about try to watch the whole game?
DAL	GHALIL EINSTEIN Sacramento had done well against Dallas this year. That was before PJ and Gafford got here. Totally different team now. It’s going to be a fun playoff.
SAC	Alec Disher I do respect kings
	They answered your questions with questions
	GHALIL EINSTEIN
DAL	I'm from Houston ...but I love Lukas energy...keep winning my guy
	Snappin Turtle Capone both teams killing it this year
DAL	💯
	Snappin Turtle Capone if you're a Rockets fan, I'm rooting for y'all to steal that 10 playin spot! Should be a fun game Sunday.
DAL	Kelly Maverick much love bruhhh
	Snappin Turtle Capone y'all got a tough one tonight. Get the dub!
	Snappin Turtle Capone hello
DAL	Remember last season when everyone said Luka and Kyrie couldn’t play together?
	🦗🦗theyre so quiet now.

DAL	Absolutely a huge win for the MAVS
DAL	Keith Sison first round exits
	Keith Sison he is included since the start of the season. LoL

DAL	No Doubt! MVP
	Kaloyski Madarcos lol, maybe if jokic doesn’t play in nba
	Kaloyski Madarcos mvp of that game without question.
	👉👉 https://wa.me/message/FCNYUVTABJDWN1
	Kaloyski Madarcos MVP for whining at referees... great player but hate his constant whingeing.
DAL	Compared to his usual stat line, this was a chill day
	Shogun Nafi very chill.
	Shogun Nafi They rested him the entire 4th.
	Shogun Nafi it's only 3 quarters worth of work.
	Shogun Nafi he only plays for 3 quarters, 32 min in total
	Shogun Nafi hasnt Played in the fourth
	Shogun Nafi he only played 3 qtrs.
	https://facebook.com/groups/6471194256237434/
	Shogun Nafi 3 quarters of work.
SAC	It was a close game!
DAL	🤣
DAL	Matt Granat yeah he’s right yall. It was a close game at the half.
	😂
SAC	Matt Granat yah. Closed game for the kings.

	Luka and Kyrie are finally synchronized..it's a beautiful thing 🤷🏽...I just hope they're not peaking to soon..
	👉👉 https://wa.me/message/FCNYUVTABJDWN1
	As a mavs fan I feel kinda embarrassed for thinking this game was gonna be anywhere near close to each other
	Marcell Bennett Inbox Mr Michael O Robinson you will definitely thank me later for referring you to him 
DAL	Dallas coming for the 4th seed
DAL	Doing all this without playing the 4th quarter 💪
DAL	Even Jokic said he's the MVP
DAL	If the Mavs catch up to 4th, Luka has to be the MVP.
	Stephen Mi nope
	Nemanja Petrovic yup
	👉👉 https://wa.me/message/FCNYUVTABJDWN1
DAL	This team has great chemistry. Kyrie looks happy and  Luka gonna win MVP this year! Let’s goooo Mavs!
	2024 champion los angeles Lakers 💜💛🏆
	😆
	Lets aim 5th seed!!! Then maybe the NBA would start putting Luka next to Jokic in the MVP race!
	Michael San Antonio why not 4?
	Michael San Antonio as a 6th seed he should already be there. Jokic and russ won as 6th seeds and what Luka is doing is better statistically then both of those mvp seasons.
	Michael San Antonio We better be sixth to avoid Denver before the finals
	Michael San Antonio they honestly have a real shot for not only the 5th seed but there’s a possibility they could get as high as 4. Only 1 game back of the pelicans and 1.5 on the clippers, and they both have tougher remaining schedules compared to the mavs
DAL	Luka should definitely get MVP this year. He should have at least 2 by now.
DAL	Didn't even play the 4th quarter either 😍
DAL	When did 3 pointers made become a stat outside of points scored?
	Willie R McClinton Inbox Mr Michael O Robinson you will definitely thank me later for referring you to him 
	Took the whole 4th quarter off.
DAL	dallas cooking in kings arena
DAL	We took 2 in Dallas and now they got us at home, we gotta bounce back Friday! #Kings
	Brandon Morato that was before they got 2 big man
SAC	DjCed DulaGafford and PJ are good additions but Kings played poorly last night, Expect them to come out with more intensity and urgency.
	Brandon Morato I'll revisit later
	DjCed DulaBet I’ll be here.
	Brandon Morato it's gonna be an interesting game for sure! But I still think the Mavs will get it done. But I think it'll be much closer this time around. Mavs are like a different team since the trade!
DAL	My love Luka doncic 🏀

DAL	All this in 3quarters 🙂
	Grabehan Kyrie

DAL	Congrats mavs team
SAC	Kings have run out of Gas
	Abdul-Rashid Hakeem Banda kings have been bad on the 2nd night of back to backs all season.
	Joseph Gonzales so what?

DAL	Light the beam--toothpaste
DAL	"Great team win tonight 43-29 Dallas Mavericks against the 42-20 Sacramento Kings and now we take sole position of 6 place in.The west alright we got to bring that’s same mentality mindset to come out and be aggressive dominate hunger toughness resiliency angry mentality mindset to go out and set .The tone to let’s them we coming and we be stop for 48 minutes for 4 quarters from the opening tip down at Golden One Center on NBA TV at 9:00pm with the MFFL to bring.Thats rowiness loudest proudest roaring noises passion to affect there players and making our players feel our presence and making it our house in there place and have playoffs type of atmosphere on Friday night with 12,000 screaming fans LETS GO MAVS"". Fans alright.On the offensive end of the court get out in transition and run with pace and have that’s ball hoping from side to side and attack there players all game long on the defensive side play lock down together defense and get in front of there best players and affect there shots selection all game long like Kobe would job not finish let’s put this team out there misery on Friday night and make it 6 in row we can’t afford to take our foot of the gas let’s stomp on there throats from the opening tip and go out there and make a statement there we are for real alright on Friday night we got another massive game down there let’s goo out there and play our game for 48 minutes from the opening tip!!"
DAL	Give this man MVP already you frauds!
DAL	MVP and it's not close, don't @ me.
	Joker winning the MVP in a runaway race.
SAC	What's up with the kings and clippers smh
	Marques Mitchell no kidding! More so Clippers and Suns. They were looking SO good and its like they are falling apart. The Kings still seem to be doing well though.
DAL	Luca Magic
DAL	😎
DAL	Standing is very beautiful to the eyes...
DAL	Luka is always on them charts
DAL	Magic ✨🥂
	Nawaf friendly game?
	Opx Opx Opx 夸张
SAC	It is okay if Lakers have to meet the Kings in playIn, they have no right to play a series if they can't defeat the Kings in knockouts!
	Those number in just 3 quarters
DAL	And 3 or 4 steals 🥵
DAL	Too much scoring by Luka and Kyrie. How the other players gonna be ready later on if they don't feed them the ball instead of shooting, especially with that margin of victory?! Smdh. NOT GONE MAKE IT OUT THE WEST!
	Oscar Lozano did you even watch the game?!
	Cassie Keener no. This is a general statement if the Mavs gameplan every game. Do you understand my point? If so, agree or give me a counter point.
	Oscar Lozano well if you watch the games, you'd see a lot of passing is going on. Gotta remember, you don't get the assist unless your teammate makes the basket. Which is why I asked if you watch the games...because the statement makes no sense. Luka didn't even play any of the 4th quarter. 5 guys hit double digits
	"Cassie Keener I disagree. There is no such stat as ""Assists received but not turned into a basket"" So that premise holds no water. It's just assist. If you dont make a basket, it's a missed field goal, NOT ""Your teammate didn't make the basket from your assist.""  Like I said, if you don't get your dimes up, you ain't winning anything. So it's on the 40 M dollar man to get his dimes up. Come playoffs it'll be too late to figure out. If you playing with a superstar, it should be easier to get more points, cause he gonna be Defended more than you."
	🤷‍♀️. My point is that he does pass the ball but the person he passes to doesn't always make the shot. You're trying to say he doesn't pass. But you also don't watch the games so don't see all the passing going on. And he's not always the one who brings in the ball either. Like many people, I think you may just look at stats on a screen and judge from that instead of actually watching games and seeing what does happen. And once again, he didn't even play the 4th quarter. He scored all but 2 of those points in the first half. So it makes no sense to say he's not passing. And sometimes he passes and then that person passes it as well. It's hard to judge a game/player by stats only. You gotta actually watch the game.
DAL	And didn’t even play the 4th quarter
DAL	Lion sleeps tonight. 🤔😎✌️👊❤️

DAL	thats your #5 in the MVP ranking- nba voters. clowns
	Raymond Per and he did that in just 3 quarters. They dont value him he clearly is the season mvp this year
	Ervin Chavoso either him or jokic. am good with jokic. but having SGA and Tatum above him is nuts
	Raymond Per true
	For football tips
DAL	Luka Dončić taught me how to spell his name. 😂
	sna ito ang makatapat ng denver,, prang lumakas simula ng ma trade sa knila si gaford grabe sa ilalim..
	How many strikes dose Draymond Green get before he gets kicked out of the league?
	Dallas vs Kings???
	🙏🙏🙏 Barge Berganio hello sabi ni Luka beshy
	2Ki 12:18 Then Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had given to the Lord, together with the things he himself had given, and all the gold in the Temple store and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael, king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem.
