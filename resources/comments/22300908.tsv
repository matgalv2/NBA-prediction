	Spurs almost winning without wemby is impressive. If Sabonis gets called for the travel at the end it goes to overtime

	 ➡️🟢
	 if spurs had more points they win.

	 Yo wassup gone through your profile Please text me I work with upper class influencers! You definitely love to give a shot! Thank you💯
	 that wasn't a travel it wouldn't be if it was another team either so shut the fuck up
	Spurs' players are still young and new but yet they're always scary when they score nearly as to win.
	  Couldn't agree more
	Great to see AD’s parents both getting wins tonight! 😤😤😤
	 ummmm so are you saying Joker and Sabonis are .....wait...so which one gave birth?🤔
	This dude can't even troll properly 🤡🤣
	Domantas been playing like an all nba player this season

	Domantas Sabonis deserves more recognition in the MVP conversation than Jason Tatum.
	 BEST VIP CHANNEL PICKS, 💰💰💰💰
	 crazy I was just thinking that. Dude is a walking triple double
	The record of the rooky of the year this season will diminish his popularity. Sayang

	Sabonis &gt; Jokic. Change my mind.
	He should shave he looks funny with a beard 😆😆
	Whoa!! That was too close for comfort
	 hello
	 BEST VIP CHANNEL PICKS 💰💰💰💰
	Interesting match
	Budget Jokic
	 ??? He is Domas. Don't compare.
	 Kings are 3-2 over the Nuggets this year. Sabonis leads league in Triple Doubles &amp; Double Doubles and has a current streak of 45 Double Doubles in a row. Jokic may be the BUDGET SABONIS.
	Domantas Sabonis has his 45th consecutive double-double. He passed Moses Malone (44, 11/27/82-3/4/83) for the third-longest double-double streak since the ABA-NBA merger (1976-77)
	Miguel Jaurigue 3-1 vs jokic and more triple doubles 🙂
	 you clearly have no idea what your talking about or know anything about basketball lmao

	Ist Domantas Arvydas Son?
	Spurs trying to win but not trying to win haha
	Awit sayooooo
	Tight game
	Awit sayo
	🤍🖤
	Kings only won becasue Wemby was not playing.
	 the other 2 times the Kings beat them was because Wemby was playing.
	Closing in on Moses record
	This year's surprise triple-double leader. What now Kendrick Perkins. Is this another European white guy guilty of stat-padding after Jokic?
	Domantas Sabonis
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Sacramento Kings
	Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
	Another Good Win For The Kings 💜🖤
	Didn't think he was good, but he is good.... Dremond
	Sabonis!! 🔥!!!
	One assist shy of a Triple Double
	Insane that he wasn’t an all star 🤦‍♂️
	But... Hes not an allstar.... Ya okay
