SAS	Spurs almost winning without wemby is impressive. If Sabonis gets called for the travel at the end it goes to overtime
	Michael Myers hello

	💯
	🤣
SAS	Michael Myers that wasn't a travel it wouldn't be if it was another team either so shut the fuck up
SAS	Spurs' players are still young and new but yet they're always scary when they score nearly as to win.
SAS	ok.  Couldn't agree more
SAS	Great to see AD’s parents both getting wins tonight! 😤😤😤
	🤔
	This dude can't even troll properly 🤡🤣
SAC	Domantas been playing like an all nba player this season

SAC	The record of the rooky of the year this season will diminish his popularity. Sayang

SAC	Domantas Sabonis deserves more recognition in the MVP conversation than Jason Tatum.

SAC	Canis Lycaon crazy I was just thinking that. Dude is a walking triple double
SAC	Sabonis &gt; Jokic. Change my mind.
SAC	He should shave he looks funny with a beard 😆😆
	Whoa!! That was too close for comfort
	Chris Paynter hello
SPAM	💰💰💰💰https://t.me/+gPHXct38SMNkYWI0
	Interesting match
	Budget Jokic
SAC	Miguel Jaurigue ??? He is Domas. Don't compare.
SAC	Miguel Jaurigue Kings are 3-2 over the Nuggets this year. Sabonis leads league in Triple Doubles &amp; Double Doubles and has a current streak of 45 Double Doubles in a row. Jokic may be the BUDGET SABONIS.
SAC	Domantas Sabonis has his 45th consecutive double-double. He passed Moses Malone (44, 11/27/82-3/4/83) for the third-longest double-double streak since the ABA-NBA merger (1976-77)
SAC	Miguel Jaurigue 3-1 vs jokic and more triple doubles 🙂
SAC	Miguel Jaurigue you clearly have no idea what your talking about or know anything about basketball lmao

SAC	Kings only won becasue Wemby was not playing.
SAC	Jason Moyle the other 2 times the Kings beat them was because Wemby was playing.
	Closing in on Moses record
SAC	This year's surprise triple-double leader. What now Kendrick Perkins. Is this another European white guy guilty of stat-padding after Jokic?
SAC	Domantas Sabonis
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Sacramento Kings
SAC	Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
SAC	Another Good Win For The Kings 💜🖤
SAC	Didn't think he was good, but he is good.... Dremond
