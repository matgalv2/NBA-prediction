TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Spurs almost winning without wemby is impressive. If Sabonis gets called for the travel at the end it goes to overtime
	Michael Myers hello

	💯
	🤣
	Michael Myers that wasn't a travel it wouldn't be if it was another team either so shut the fuck up
	Spurs' players are still young and new but yet they're always scary when they score nearly as to win.
	ok.  Couldn't agree more
	Great to see AD’s parents both getting wins tonight! 😤😤😤
	🤔
	This dude can't even troll properly 🤡🤣
	Domantas been playing like an all nba player this season
	💰🤑💰💰
	The record of the rooky of the year this season will diminish his popularity. Sayang

	Domantas Sabonis deserves more recognition in the MVP conversation than Jason Tatum.

	Canis Lycaon crazy I was just thinking that. Dude is a walking triple double
	Sabonis &gt; Jokic. Change my mind.
	He should shave he looks funny with a beard 😆😆
	Whoa!! That was too close for comfort
	Chris Paynter hello
	💰💰💰💰https://t.me/+gPHXct38SMNkYWI0
	Interesting match
	Budget Jokic
	Miguel Jaurigue ??? He is Domas. Don't compare.
	Miguel Jaurigue Kings are 3-2 over the Nuggets this year. Sabonis leads league in Triple Doubles &amp; Double Doubles and has a current streak of 45 Double Doubles in a row. Jokic may be the BUDGET SABONIS.
	Domantas Sabonis has his 45th consecutive double-double. He passed Moses Malone (44, 11/27/82-3/4/83) for the third-longest double-double streak since the ABA-NBA merger (1976-77)
	Miguel Jaurigue 3-1 vs jokic and more triple doubles 🙂
	Miguel Jaurigue you clearly have no idea what your talking about or know anything about basketball lmao

	Awit sayooooo
	Nohjhenry Almodovar hahaha mukhang tumagibang ah
	kulang 1 assist sir
	Tight game
	Awit sayo
	🤍🖤
	Kings only won becasue Wemby was not playing.
	Jason Moyle the other 2 times the Kings beat them was because Wemby was playing.
	Closing in on Moses record
	This year's surprise triple-double leader. What now Kendrick Perkins. Is this another European white guy guilty of stat-padding after Jokic?
	Domantas Sabonis
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Sacramento Kings
	Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
	Another Good Win For The Kings 💜🖤
	Didn't think he was good, but he is good.... Dremond
	Sabonis!! 🔥!!!
	Insane that he wasn’t an all star 🤦‍♂️
	One assist shy of a Triple Double
	But... Hes not an allstar.... Ya okay
