NOP	That ball 🏀 has been dropping consistently for CJ .He’s hott… can anybody talk on Zion steals… everybody saw his 31 points which was phenomenal
NOP	Very proud of you, CJ. Keep focused and finish strong! Geaux Pels! 💪
NOP	Wanted this bro as the shooting guard for the Knicks
SAC	I'm sorry I think the league has something against the kings because there's no reason why there's three teams that were not in the play in picture all the sudden and 5th and 6th while we go from 5th to 8th in less than a month
	David Emmons refs control the pace of the game like when they played against OKC, SGA wiggles his head and gets sent to the line to shoot 20 freethrows. While Colby Jones can get smacked in the face on the final shot of the Celtics game in front of the refs and it get ignored.  The nba has had it out for the kings since 2002 lol
	Joseph Gonzales well yeah most the older fans have known that casual fans don't know that because the NBA wants to convince everybody that Sacramento is not important City to California yeah we deserve a better team because we're paying those shittier cities their bills
NOP	The #DameTime CJ is back 🏀🏀🏀
	Hoped they tire themselves out before the next game against Warriors😂
	Great run and win by the Pels. But still don’t trust this team in a best of 7.
