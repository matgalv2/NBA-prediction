	Ruel Hibalay Eyas ok
	It’s honestly good to see the magic are half decent again
	He wouldn't have had to if he had hit two free throws moments earlier 😉
	Robert Wróblewski can’t base it off that because you can also said he didn’t need to if the other team didn’t score 30 point
	Traveling ….but I’ll take it as a magic fan. 4 straight
	Game winning shot vs the worst team in the NBA isn't as impressive as people think
	Mark Madsen After 5 years of marriage with my boyfriend with two children, my boyfriend started behaving strangely and meeting other ladies and showing me cold love, threatening me with divorce several times if I dared to ask him about the relationship… Wyświetl więcej

	No one on the team scored 20.. in this new nba that’s almost impossible! This team is 10 years behind the elite teams by far… draft will not save them they going to have to spend some money for a change
	Jermaine Lee this team drop almost all those elite teams wtf you talking about😭
	Gxvani Pharoe II will not beat.. Celtics, Bucks, Heat, Pacers, Sixers, Cavs or Knicks in a playoff series! Let’s not even mention the West
	Jermaine Lee who cares long as dem bring dat heat n perform at a high level as much dem can is all dat matters #Hater#
	Ras  Elijah high level.. you are measured by stats…. It’s titles
	Jermaine Lee I can tell you don't play ball for exercise and recreation if you did you would learn it's not about beating anyone, it's about improving self every game and dat way you have a positive spirit and you win every time you step foot on dat co… Wyświetl więcej

	I'm glad the Magic won, but that was traveling. https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/... Step back onto his left foot, then lifts it completely off the floor a second time, violation all day long.
	NBA explain to me how Cade had 56 points in two games and ZERO free throws. What are yall trying to do to this man?
	Game winning shot taking about 10 steps😂😂😂Officiating in all sports has become absolutely comical!
