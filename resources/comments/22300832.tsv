TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	It's almost like the Mavs having 2 players that take 75% of their shots doesn't work... Who would have guessed
	Scott Palmer shi t take
	Scott Palmer You're not understanding it's because the rest of the team is garbage.
	Scott Palmer note the zero defense played as well!
	Scott I'm a HUGE Luka fan and I agree. I forgot who they were up against but when he’s applying off-ball movement to his game, setting screeens for his teammates, and bullying the opponent's PG with his size, they got the dub. Hopefully he incorporates… Wyświetl więcej
	Scott Palmer you don’t watch basketball shut up
	Scott Palmer guy didnt watch the game at all
	Scott Palmer you clearly don’t watch their games.
	Scott Palmer they lost by a full-court heave. Calm tf down they're 7-1 in the last 8
	Scott Palmer dumbass alert
	Scott Palmer they seriously lost on a miracle buzzer beater, can’t fault them too much.
	Scott Palmer Bruh an 8th &amp; 7th seed were in the CF last year seriously weakest era players miss games on purpose and always cry for and1’s
	Scott Palmer they are 33-25
	Better than Luka. He should be in MVP race since he is carrying his team to top 2 spot.
	Serkan Karatepe Luka scored 45 points, 9 rebounds, 14 assists, 3 steals, and had only ONE turnover.
	Serkan Karatepe lie out your ass some more
	Serkan Karatepe carrying of what  sack of rice🤣🤣🤣
	Serkan Karatepe no way he’s not.  Luka doesn’t have any talent around him outside of Kyrie
	Serkan Karatepe he probably won’t even play enough games to qualify.
	Serkan Karatepe daj si sam šus v glavo
	That game winning shot will be the Play of the Week.
	The refs sold the game. They're clearly letting the Cavs win, but Dallas put up a fight until that Struss' buzzer beater.
	Cosette Schneider   Stop it.  That going in was absolute karma for the tackle on Garland that would have been 2 free throws.
	Autumn Biggins you stop! There are many foul calls that could've been called but the refs didn't want to.
	Cosette Schneider Darius Garland was literally tackled by hardy to the ground… how about the missed goaltend early in the game??
	Justin Mize there were missed calls all throughout the game but just watch the WHOLE game and count how many calls have been missed to the Mavs, especially on crucial minutes. They know home team's gonna lose. If it wasn't for Struss' crucial shot, the refs could've been punching the air right now as they sold the game
	Autumn Biggins Mate did you not watch the last 5 minutes of the game? moving screen from allen, the chop on the head from lavert on josh green in the corner, and that should have been a jumpball on garland, not a timeout call. cavs got bailed out and you know it.
	Brandon Lacey   I watched the whole game.  Green flopped go back and watch slow motion.  A tackle is a foul, not a jump ball, and Mitchell can be seen screaming for it a full three seconds before it was given.  The Mavs lost dude, move on.
	https://twitter.com/IsoHeavy/status/1762670394874490968?s=20 at least 5/6 crucial calls missed in crucial minutes. I know how you'd be reacting if it was your team bud. Most of us mavs fans knew that strus shot was going in after hitting 6 in the last. I ain't mad that we lost bro but you can't deny the officiating was utterly atrocious.
	Autumn Biggins Mitchell screaming to coach to call for time out not on the ref
	Cosette Schneider so every time Dallas lose you’re going to complain it was to referees fault stop it ￼
	I love how stats matter over the game winner! 🤷‍♂️
	Brian Wayne Boyett I know right?
	That final shot from half court by Struss! 😭 #MFFL
	Saddest loss of the year for the mavs
	JKidd making sure the Cavs got this one when he benched Gafford all game the while giving THJ and Kleber 27+mins of bricks and zero defense 💩
	Max Strus was the hero of the night.
	Charly Celis right!! How bout Strus leads Cavs down the stretch in the 4th to beat the Mavs. THE only reason they won the game the last 4 minutes.
	Jeremy Shipley yesss! I thought they would lose that game cause the mavs lead 10 if I'm not mistaken in the crucial minute but Strus made 3 straight three pointers the reason they beat the mavs.
	Charly Celis he made 4 straight and someone else hit one and then of course Strus hit his 5th in under 4 minutes to win. I think they actually hit 6 straight threes without missing
	Charly Celis think the refs were more of the hero
	Charly Celis refs were trying to play hero for the Mavs until Strus shut that shit down 🔥
	Steven Bodner for real!!! That’s straight karma for literally tackling Garland and not getting that crap called.
	Yup Fluka and the mavs gone home early this year 🤣💯🤣
	Nathan Smith you are out of your mind.  Luka is the hottest player in the league right now
	Katrin Poetschke Cagle so hot that the Cavs cooled him down 🤣🤣🤣
	Nathan Smith no they didn’t.  He had 45 points.  Kyrie had 30.  Cavs won by a lucky half court shot
	Katrin Poetschke Cagle then why they loss 🤣🤣 where was the defense
	Nathan Smith yes you are correct we lost because of defense.  But you are trying to say that Luka is “Fluka”.  You couldn’t be more wrong.  He’s a generational talent.
	Katrin Poetschke Cagle he is a great and I honestly just joced on him you taking it too personal ppl do the same everyday all day it’s just sports. But I don’t think he gone win a chip unless he change up his style of play a lil bit 🤷🏾‍♂️💯
	Refs are the 4th quarter MVPs
	lost is on Kidd he should have take time out when Struss got 🔥 in last 5min of the game and double him until the end...but still Mavs show they can fight💪
	That was a highlight reel by Strus 🤲🏽
	Dallas is closer to gsw 30-27
	Max strus greatest cavs players of all time 
	あさひな まふゆ you're LONELY
	Just Tuesday (literally) for spida. It was Strus callin game tonight
	The problem is change the coach, b4 loss to the playoff.
	Alexander Espanto the coach that has the best record since January? 😂😂🤡 You fans are something else
	Max strus should do that in a nightly basis.. Lets see if he can be consistent. Their last game he only got 3 pts. 7/10 3pts in a nightly basis. Ill be watching.
	Jaikumar Fontejon boy got lucky
	Jaikumar Fontejon he will be back to his 4 points a night or whatever he averages
	Alex Bendana thats true
	Let's make it 40 wins brosss
	CAVALIERS💥💥💥
	Amazing game! Amazing last shot! ❤️MyCavs!
	its almost a Win. 🙁
	Not a playoff baller

	🕷🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
	The real MVPs are the 4th qtr refs 🤡 They called a tech on Luka for shouting And 1, they took away 3 free throws from Green, didnt call a clear path foul, they took away 2 points from Irving while strus was pushing him out of his driving lane, and they didnt call the foul on the rim finish from washington, of course dallas was going to lose if they refs were on the cavs side 😂
	Ramirez Ramirez
	Ramirez Ramirez you left out the missed calls for the other side. Not surprised since you're crying on Facebook about it 😭😭😭😭
	Ramirez Ramirez the refs robbed at least 8 points to the Mavs in 4th quarter.
	Russel Gian Tan Peñalosa yeah also a basket interference and a offensive call on green that wasn't called
	Ramirez Ramirez too many missed calls and wrong calls, man. That offensive foul by Kyrie on Strus was bs. How was it an offensive foul when Strus was moving his feet and pushing Kyrie?
	"Russel Gian Tan Peñalosa i know tv commentators was like ""uuuuh"" ""yeah I know your comment is correct some questionable call"""
	Russel Gian Tan Peñalosa you can clearly see Strus locking his arm
	Javier Lopez Mavs have given their all into this game despicable of so many lapses, they were just unfortunate that refs bet on the opposing team. Strus wouldn’t have to be in that moment and make the half court if the refs just officiated this game fairly.
	Ramirez Ramirez Garland given the timeout when he clearly travelled and then tied up. BS. Refs had money on this one.
	Ramirez Ramirez    You're high dude.  Luka needs to keep his mouth shut.  Green flopped, he is lucky that wasn't a tech.  Irving should have been called for an over the back, and at 9 seconds Garland was tackled which should have been free throws.
	Ramirez Ramirez 💯
	The Cavs ain't no joke💯
	Don't be too glad.
	陳冠綸 chat me now to make you feel like a man
	Jeff Kozey we have no idea if that would happen as the Mavs players would have been father back already to prepare after a missed free throw. If the refs called it correctly could be vastly different. You don’t know the sport.
	Josh Clark not to mention they aren't even going to have anyone rebounding because CLEVELAND WAS OUT OF TIMEOUTS. They weren't going to get caught sleeping on a run out. It's common sense 🤦
	Jeff Kozey that was someone else’s not me. You never read who posted that.
	Donovan Mitchell
	Thanks refs and Draft Kings for that L. Worst officiated 4th quarter of the year.
	Dallas Mavericks Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
	NBA gonna be like: “Luka climbs to number 1 on the MVP ladder.” 😒
	Kyrie will soon want that trade 👀
	It’s odd to me how there was so much talk around the trade deadline about breaking this team up. Why? Seems like they’re on to something
	又不是靠他笑死...😅
	Yawa kagid Mitchell luoy man Luka 😢
	MAX STRUS WAS ON FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
	Puran B. Joshua
	POTG: Max Strus
	Them refs sold it so hard. I couldn’t believe it 😂🤡
	I’m blessing the lives of first 7 people to hit me up with BLESSED

	Refs sold out. If you watched the entire game I can count 5 instances in the last 5 minutes they let the Cavs get away with no calls and tic tac fouls but none for the Mavs. Especially that non foul on Josh Greens 3 pointer, that offensive foul on Kyrie with a minute left. And the no call on PJ Washing dunk!!!! WTF!!!!
	No mention on Garland traveling when he was getting locked up for a tied up and they gave him the timeout. FKD UP!!!!!
	Javier Lopez   Yes it was fucked up that they didn't call Dallas for a foul on that play.
	Autumn Biggins for what traveling?
	Javier Lopez   For tackling him.  Refs need to start being fined for missing something that obvious.
	Autumn Biggins They had ball on ball. He traveled before that happened.
	Javier Lopez   Absolutely not.  Green flopped.  Irving very clearly hooked Struss.  Irving should have been called for an over and back, Garland was fucking tackled with 9 seconds left and it should have been free throws.
	Autumn Biggins east game did you watch?
	Israel Arguello   The one that was actually on and played.
	Autumn Biggins you are in the minority on this one.If you look around the fans all agree with the fix.Mavs were fleeced.
	Autumn Biggins Calling a tech on Luka for yelling And 1 when everyone does it? Really? Saw the Green 3 pointer in slow motion and cleary a foul on the wrist. No over and back on Irving as he was taking his two steps and cleary Strus had him locked up in Kai’s motion. Garland clearly traveled BEFORE he was tied up or “tackled”.
	Some does not understand what it mean to get paid. Wow all thanks to Mrs kiana Danial
	The Mavs piss away more leads than any team in the NBA!
	Insane
	I'm sorry but as a loyal Mavs fan since 2011, Fluka needs to go. He's just a stat padding guy who doesn't care about winning. He only cares for his stats. His high scoring don't mean sht if he can't even play defense and can actually lead the team to a championship. Dude also frequently whines to the refs instead of playing defense which is why the Mavs will never win. We need a true PG that makes the team better.
	The refs is the real Hero🤑🤣😡
	NBA ReFs are all blind
	Sad for Luka
	LUCKY SHOT
