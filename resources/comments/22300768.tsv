DAL	Luka for MVP.
	Renato Lopez   Hold your horses.  Cavs were down two starters for six weeks and went on a 16-4 tear with Mobley and Garland out. Donovan Mitchell who has become an excellent two way player has been responsible for keeping the ship afloat with Jarrett Allen.  Cavs are 2nd in the East and are 17-2 since January started. He should be in the conversation over Luka all due respect.

	Wow another triple double na namn lakas mag assists ahh nakakaLUKA ang galing nito
DAL	Luka Magic 😍😍😍
DAL	Don't forget Gafford's hustle for the rebounds I don't know why they sat him down should of kept him in. Sometimes the coaching calls make me question J. Kidd
	Ramirez Ramirez coz they're more familiar on spacing up the floor on crucial minutes, and allows Luka &amp; Kai to operate in the paint and separates them on double teams, if they got doubled it's a 4 on 3 situation which is favourable to make plays and get open shots
DAL	Luka Doncik is the best basketball player of the Dallas Mavericks and the NBA.He should be a lock for MVP award this year
	JP 1-12 FG🥶
	Happy bday🍺🎂💐#Lively my same day
