	Luka for MVP.
	Renato Lopez   Hold your horses.  Cavs were down two starters for six weeks and went on a 16-4 tear with Mobley and Garland out. Donovan Mitchell who has become an excellent two way player has been responsible for keeping the ship afloat with Jarrett Allen.  Cavs are 2nd in the East and are 17-2 since January started. He should be in the conversation over Luka all due respect.

	Renato Lopez would help if he ever heard the word defense.

	Kyrie lodi
	Wow another triple double na namn lakas mag assists ahh nakakaLUKA ang galing nito
	Luka Magic 😍😍😍
	Don't forget Gafford's hustle for the rebounds I don't know why they sat him down should of kept him in. Sometimes the coaching calls make me question J. Kidd
	Ramirez Ramirez coz they're more familiar on spacing up the floor on crucial minutes, and allows Luka &amp; Kai to operate in the paint and separates them on double teams, if they got doubled it's a 4 on 3 situation which is favourable to make plays and get open shots
	Luka Doncik is the best basketball player of the Dallas Mavericks and the NBA.He should be a lock for MVP award this year
	JP 1-12 FG🥶
	Happy bday🍺🎂💐#Lively my same day
	Awesome Job Luka Doncic! Keep up the Luka Magic 🪄 &amp; good teamwork offensively and defensively!!🏀🎉🎉
	Only if Poole scored some points
	David James-Moller Mavs played awful last night and still won.
	Let’s gooo great team win 31-23 Dallas Mavericks alright tonight at the American Airlines Center alright at home against 9-44 the Washington Wizards.Now we must get prepared for the 11-43 San Antonio Spurs coming to your house on Bally Sports Southwest at 7:30pm tho and we must go out there and set.The tone with aggressive hunger toughness fight  passion intensity resiliency to go out there and bring the energy for 48 minutes from the opening tip for 4 quarters and hopefully the MFFL bring the rowdiness loudest proudest roaring nosies resiliencey electricity ⚡️ passion with 20,000 screaming fans alright to go out.There and help our players feed our energy and go out there and have that’s business like approach mavericks players and go out there and set the tone with our defensive and get our there and play with pace on the offensive side of the court and bring it on Wednesday night at 7:30pm with effort and we can’t afford to this team lightly and got to come out with that’s killer instinct and lock in  to go out there and get another win alright on Wednesday night tho and lock in from the opening tip for 4 quarters
	HOW MANY coaches have been ejected this year already, HOW MANY coaches have been fined. The NBA has ZERO INTREGITY.
