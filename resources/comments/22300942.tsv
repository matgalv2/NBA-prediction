	@nba I'm wondering....Luka Dončić in on 5th place on MVP ladder - reason is that his team has to win if he wants to climb...now on Rookie Ladder we have Wembanyama on first place and his team is the worst on west side...and here is not important that team wins or what?
	 ROY is different because the best rookies are always sent to the worst teams. I still believe he should be second because one of the best indicators of success is a better record than before they joined imo. And the spurs are worse this year.
