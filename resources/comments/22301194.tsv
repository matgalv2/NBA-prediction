TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHX	Congrats Suns. Good performances in this game 👏👏
MIN	😭
	Willy Rahadian
PHX	nice, get your win now. The wolves are taking you out first round!
MIN	I see Minnesota didn't want to play the Pelicans
	Gerard Robins pelicans ? They not even making the playoffs . What u talking about ? 😂😂 they finna lose to lakers . Then lose to golden state
	Armando Frias Pelicans getting in
	Gerard Robins who y’all gonna beat ?
PHX	Armando Frias We can beat the Lakers, Kings, or GS. To honest I'll rather see OKC than Denver
	😂 if we get past wolves we play winner of Denver or whoever it is
	Gerard Robins what game you watched today make you think they beating LAL Tuesday?
	Thaddeus Banks Jr. It doesn't matter like I said I'll rather the Pelicans play OKC. I don't think LAL want to see Denver either
	Gerard Robins the pelicans not coming out the first round if they even get in.
	Gerard Robins OKC dog walked the pelicans in the season series.
	Thaddeus Banks Jr. I can't argue with you on that first round thing
	Gerard Robins out all teams the the play in the Pels the weakest link everyone else playing better ball other than maybe the kings
	Thaddeus Banks Jr. Lakers are losing on purpose next game to avoid Denver.
	Francisco Rim can’t avoid them if you plan to get out the west.
	Thaddeus Banks Jr. I'll just watch and see what happen
	Gerard Robins ... I saw the pelicans get stomped by the Lakers
	Gerard Robins cringe. They got toasted by the suns
PHX	Yay!!!!! Go SUNS goooooi🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
MIN	It looks like the Wolves will get burned.
PHX	I can see Suns making the WCF and pushing the Nuggets to a game 7. KD, Booker, and Beal is a huge upgrade over KD, Booker, CP3, and Ayton. Having guys like Grayson Allen, Nurkic, Eric Gordon, and Isaiah Thomas certainly helps too. Suns are actually deeper than credited.
PHX	Loc Tran Suns will play Nuggets in the 2nd round if both teams make through 1st round...
	Loc Tran yung gsw nla tiyk ibubuhos ang galit ng kings sa knla pag nagharp cla go.mgo..kings win yan
PHX	The Suns not going any where in the playoffs
MIN	As a wolves fan, this was painful to watch…
MIN	Dan Zastrow I’m sure the last two games vs Suns were painful
	Dan Zastrowedwards is going to have better game this first round big time
PHX	Dan Zastrow I mean, they made it to the playoffs. That's still saying something
MIN	Jefferson Liang yea but they weren’t as good last year and everyone knew they wouldn’t beat Denver.  This year they’re way better, but don’t do well against the suns and now we have to play them first round.
MIN	Dan Zastrow The Wolves are way better than they were last year. The best part about the playoffs is the ability to make adjustments.
MIN	Wolves about to get knocked out fast
	Jeremy Behnke  This will be decided up to Game 6 or 7. 
MIN	Game 1 is a must win for the wolves
MIN	Anor Erkhbat in your dreams. Sleepwell wolves fans
	Anything can happen in the playoff...let's see..
	You’re welcome from a Lakers fan
	Luis Felipe Garcia cringe. You guys think everything is a win for the lakers. Gonna get tossed in the playin
	Stephen Brooks okay? To the person w a pic of a stupid cat as their profile picture, meow much
	Luis Felipe Garcia irrelevant to the conversation lol. Good for you tho bro for looking like an insecure little man for insulting somebody over a profile picture.
	Phoenix Suns Vs Minnesota Timberwolves
PHX	Let’s go 🏆
MIN	Will we see same results in the first round of playoffs between Suns and Wolves?
PHX	Will we see same results in the first round of playoffs between Suns and Wolves?

PHX	Suns in 4
MIN	This was a bad game for the Timberwolves, but now that it's a series and not a regular season meeting, it's a whole new season.
MIN	Joe Kaspszak T’wolves seem to be chokers as well since they haven’t won a title in the last few years….
	Joe Kaspszak... you're projecting, sir ...
MIN	Joe Kaspszak cringe post. When is the last time wolves even won a series? Kevin Garnett days? Suns made the finals a couple years ago. Logic is dumb to say they are chokers
PHX	Suns in 6

	Edževid Ecko Redžepović susrest će se u PO i bogme Wolvesima ne pašu Sunsi..
	Ante Boban ali vraća se KAT. I ne znam kako će zaustaviti Sunsi njega i Goberta sa samim Nurkićem. Bojim se nikako. Ali, navijam tu za Sunse.
