	Congrats Suns. Good performances in this game 👏👏
	
	nice, get your win now. The wolves are taking you out first round!
	I see Minnesota didn't want to play the Pelicans
	Yay!!!!! Go SUNS goooooi🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
	It looks like the Wolves will get burned. I can see Suns making the WCF and pushing the Nuggets to a game 7. KD, Booker, and Beal is a huge upgrade over KD, Booker, CP3, and Ayton. Having guys like Grayson Allen, Nurkic, Eric Gordon, and Isaiah Thomas certainly helps too. Suns are actually deeper than credited.
	The Suns not going any where in the playoffs
	Wolves about to get knocked out fast
	As a wolves fan, this was painful to watch…
	Game 1 is a must win for the wolves
	Anything can happen in the playoff...let's see..

	T wolves vs Suns it seems a good match up

	This was a bad game for the Timberwolves, but now that it's a series and not a regular season meeting, it's a whole new season.
