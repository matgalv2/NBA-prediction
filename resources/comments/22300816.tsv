TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Congratulations Boston but don’t let this distract you from the fact that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time!
	That was a fantastic game. Rivals face to face, but the Celtics were the better team. The others better watch out, ‘cause they want that championship.
	This is why he is an All-Star. Well done player.
	It's clearer now. It's a rematch between the Warriors and Celtics in the NBA Finals 2024.
	4-0 against the Knicks this season 🫰☘️
	But Stephen a said Knicks team to beat
	Way to go team!
	The better team won for now
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers is the 2023-24 NBA Champion and King James is the FMVP 🐐 👑
	Good job Boston. I see a deep playoff push if everyone can stay healthy.
	World championship 🏆💪🏽 this season 💯💯💯☘️☘️☘️
	Play off time and let’s take on the Knicks again.. that will prove for sure who the best team is in the east.. go celts!
	Let's see if they have that same energy when the Knicks are with a full roster....they should have blown the Knicks by 20 something pts
	Celtics first round exit!!!!?
	He was cooking all game
	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪
	Congrats.. slamdunk joker...🤭
	Johnny Wang the Miami heat could never 😂

	Oh the greatest dunker of all time, can jump over a wheelchair
	Awesome
	jaylen I love you dawg you're my boy but can you never do the dee no look dunk again that wasn't it bro you're supposed to cover your eyes as you dunk not after you see the rim
	This will go down as one of the greatest dunker of all time.. covering his eyes after the unimaginable dunk.
	Guapz Odaibmac Onasabal NBA back in regular games.You're head still in that all star.Pathetic
	Beating a Short-Handed Knicks 🤣 but if the guys are here, this is gonna be a Hell for the Celtics
	Bernard Vasquez
	They are just basketballs version of the Dallas cowboys. Dominate in the regular season then find some comedic way to lose in the playoffs
	The only remaining question is what team the Mighty Boston Celtics will be playing in the finals! 
	Edward White they won't make it
	Can’t get over onJB’s no look dunk 🥱🥱
	Olan Pagatpat I can’t get over him actually winning something like a regular season win. Nobody cares about the dunk contest
	Castor Troy are you sure nobody cares? JB want to compete again next year🫢🫢just because of nobody cares?
	The best dunker ever.. better than mj and vince carter..
	Jaylen Brown is one of my favorites!!!
	After soo many years trailing behind.
	Another big victory !! 💪🏼☘️
	Knicks fans back to crying again after winning the month of January and winning the trade deadline...the excuse is they got injured players.....new flash everybody got injured players
	Ronnie Matthews lmao a healthy Celtics vs injured Knicks. But u hype foh. 🤣
	Ronnie Matthews bruh I'm born n raised in queens. Stop tryna act tough. Knicks ain't healthy. Period. It's facts. Yall fully clean. What are we really talkin bout. Stop it.
	David Busler 4 times wit a while different roster each time but kudos 👏
	Ronnie Matthews how ironic lmao 😂 didn’t Celtics fan cry a river when JT was hurt last year against my Heat ? 😂🤣
	Jeffrey Carter look at that a crybaby who's team didn't even play worried about a celtics vs knicks topic...bandwagon fans everywhere
	Knicks still booing KP is hillarious. Freaks
	So?
	I agree with you
	Let's go Celtics ☘️
