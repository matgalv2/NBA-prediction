TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
BOS	Congratulations Boston but don’t let this distract you from the fact that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time!
BOS	That was a fantastic game. Rivals face to face, but the Celtics were the better team. The others better watch out, ‘cause they want that championship.
BOS	This is why he is an All-Star. Well done player.
BOS	It's clearer now. It's a rematch between the Warriors and Celtics in the NBA Finals 2024.
BOS	4-0 against the Knicks this season 🫰☘️
	But Stephen a said Knicks team to beat
BOS	Way to go team!
BOS	The better team won for now
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers is the 2023-24 NBA Champion and King James is the FMVP 🐐 👑
BOS	Good job Boston. I see a deep playoff push if everyone can stay healthy.
BOS	World championship 🏆💪🏽 this season 💯💯💯☘️☘️☘️
BOS	Play off time and let’s take on the Knicks again.. that will prove for sure who the best team is in the east.. go celts!
BOS	Let's see if they have that same energy when the Knicks are with a full roster....they should have blown the Knicks by 20 something pts
BOS	Celtics first round exit!!!!?
BOS	He was cooking all game
BOS	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪

BOS	Oh the greatest dunker of all time, can jump over a wheelchair
BOS	Awesome
BOS	jaylen I love you dawg you're my boy but can you never do the dee no look dunk again that wasn't it bro you're supposed to cover your eyes as you dunk not after you see the rim
BOS	This will go down as one of the greatest dunker of all time.. covering his eyes after the unimaginable dunk.
	Guapz Odaibmac Onasabal NBA back in regular games.You're head still in that all star.Pathetic
	Beating a Short-Handed Knicks 🤣 but if the guys are here, this is gonna be a Hell for the Celtics
	Bernard Vasquez
BOS	They are just basketballs version of the Dallas cowboys. Dominate in the regular season then find some comedic way to lose in the playoffs
BOS	The only remaining question is what team the Mighty Boston Celtics will be playing in the finals!
	Edward White they won't make it
BOS	Can’t get over onJB’s no look dunk 🥱🥱
	Olan Pagatpat I can’t get over him actually winning something like a regular season win. Nobody cares about the dunk contest
	Castor Troy are you sure nobody cares? JB want to compete again next year🫢🫢just because of nobody cares?
BOS	The best dunker ever.. better than mj and vince carter..
BOS	Jaylen Brown is one of my favorites!!!
BOS	After soo many years trailing behind.
BOS	Another big victory !! 💪🏼☘️
NYK	Knicks fans back to crying again after winning the month of January and winning the trade deadline...the excuse is they got injured players.....new flash everybody got injured players
