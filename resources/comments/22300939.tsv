TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Now you see why Embiid is an MVP.
	He has no skills at all! He literally plays like a 10 Day contract player
	Lol the other day sixers won 79-73, this tien time scored the same amount but knicks scored 33 more
	Josh hart has completely revitalized his career. Hard to believe he’s had 19 boards at guard when it’s the same guy who was posterized so badly I thought he would need therapy
	Tibbs should’ve let him get his 20th rebound
	19 rebounds impressive
	In a 27 point win, Hart still plays 39 minutes… Thibs won’t stop until everyone is injured
	Knicks might end up in third or fourth place in the eastern conference when the regular season ends.
	Should get 6th player of the year, so underrated
	Now they felt the Harden trade.
	The stats in the caption belong to Brunson though
	Former Laker player LeBron effect 👍💪💪💪💪
	⛳What sport is represented by this sign?⛳👈
	Embid had this team considered championship caliber lmao
	Hart hustles every play. We need more players like him in the NBA
	That's a big game lota boards for a 6'4 guard or undersized small forward he's definitely a keeper
	79 points back to back games for the sixers
	Let’s go NYKnicks
	He plays with hart
	That defense is insane!!
	Boardman gets paid 💪🏾
	We still need Mitch for the playoffs
	The real number 3 of the Knicks is John starks that boy could shoot foul shots
	Josh Hart put up a performance
	Very easy win for the Knicks tonight. Good to have OG back. Knicks are the best defensive team in the league. Once this team gets back fully healthy,they’re gonna be scary good BING BONGGGGGGGGG 🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽
	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
	That’s the Knicks I know
	The OG Anunoby effect.
	19 boards as a guard, ain’t no bigs in the paint they running down court tryna get a bucket
	Lift? Or blowout. The sixers are terrible.  Your local high-school team would beat them. Good thing they spent 8 years losing on purpose, drafting injured players, salary dumping....etc it's all working out for them in the end ! Worst owners in pro sports that Noone talks about for some reason. Just complete shit.  Call it a year and raise the ticket prices again.  Then wonder why we don't show up
	I hope this team knocks out Celtics.
	What a shame that this kind of players used to wear the purple and yellow 🥺 and now shinning with other teams
	Such an awful team to watch going no where in this league with that style
	pls pay this man more...he deserved it
	Sixers fell all the way off
	😆 79 points.  How low can you go
	So many blowouts
	Ahmad Pratt I ain't gonna lie bro, your Knicks are starting to look pretty scary. My Magic are putting it together as well but you guys look totally different since the OG trade
	What happen to maxey?
	Leon G Orias He played tonight. He's coming back from a concussion.
	Scott Neal sixers season .. come to an end.. Daryl Morey is cursed by James harden!
	Leon G Orias Go Knicks!
	And he's 6'4
	Come on embiid we need you 🥲
	Hoani Fuller
	🧡💙

	All the players Lakers gave up for Lbj and AD all stars now😳 should of waited
	Sixers are crashing
	In a 27 point win, Hart still plays 39 minutes… Thibs won’t stop until everyone is injured
	This dude
	Josh Hart
	"Josh ""The Lion"" Hart"
	Wow triple double ahh
	AL Prince another triple double. He just had one a few nights ago also.
