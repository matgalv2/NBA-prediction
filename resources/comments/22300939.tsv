TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHI	Now you see why Embiid is an MVP.
PHI	He has no skills at all! He literally plays like a 10 Day contract player
PHI	Lol the other day sixers won 79-73, this tien time scored the same amount but knicks scored 33 more
NYK	Josh hart has completely revitalized his career. Hard to believe he’s had 19 boards at guard when it’s the same guy who was posterized so badly I thought he would need therapy
NYK	Tibbs should’ve let him get his 20th rebound
NYK	19 rebounds impressive
NYK	In a 27 point win, Hart still plays 39 minutes… Thibs won’t stop until everyone is injured
NYK	Knicks might end up in third or fourth place in the eastern conference when the regular season ends.
NYK	Should get 6th player of the year, so underrated
NYK	Now they felt the Harden trade.
NYK	The stats in the caption belong to Brunson though
	Former Laker player LeBron effect 👍💪💪💪💪
	⛳What sport is represented by this sign?⛳👈
PHI	Embid had this team considered championship caliber lmao
NYK	Hart hustles every play. We need more players like him in the NBA
NYK	That's a big game lota boards for a 6'4 guard or undersized small forward he's definitely a keeper
PHI	79 points back to back games for the sixers
PHI	Let’s go NYKnicks
NYK	He plays with hart
NYK	That defense is insane!!
	Boardman gets paid 💪🏾
NYK	We still need Mitch for the playoffs
NYK	The real number 3 of the Knicks is John starks that boy could shoot foul shots
NYK	Josh Hart put up a performance
NYK	Very easy win for the Knicks tonight. Good to have OG back. Knicks are the best defensive team in the league. Once this team gets back fully healthy,they’re gonna be scary good BING BONGGGGGGGGG 🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽
NYK	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
NYK	That’s the Knicks I know
NYK	The OG Anunoby effect.
NYK	19 boards as a guard, ain’t no bigs in the paint they running down court tryna get a bucket
PHI	Lift? Or blowout. The sixers are terrible.  Your local high-school team would beat them. Good thing they spent 8 years losing on purpose, drafting injured players, salary dumping....etc it's all working out for them in the end ! Worst owners in pro sports that Noone talks about for some reason. Just complete shit.  Call it a year and raise the ticket prices again.  Then wonder why we don't show up
NYK	I hope this team knocks out Celtics.
NYK	What a shame that this kind of players used to wear the purple and yellow 🥺 and now shinning with other teams
PHI	Such an awful team to watch going no where in this league with that style
NYK	pls pay this man more...he deserved it
PHI	Sixers fell all the way off
PHI	😆 79 points.  How low can you go
	So many blowouts
NYK	Ahmad Pratt I ain't gonna lie bro, your Knicks are starting to look pretty scary. My Magic are putting it together as well but you guys look totally different since the OG trade
PHI	What happen to maxey?
PHI	Leon G Orias He played tonight. He's coming back from a concussion.
PHI	Scott Neal sixers season .. come to an end.. Daryl Morey is cursed by James harden!
NYK	Leon G Orias Go Knicks!
NYK	And he's 6'4
PHI	Come on embiid we need you 🥲
	Hoani Fuller

	All the players Lakers gave up for Lbj and AD all stars now😳 should of waited
PHI	Sixers are crashing
NYK	In a 27 point win, Hart still plays 39 minutes… Thibs won’t stop until everyone is injured
NYK	This dude
NYK	Josh Hart
