TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Now you see why Embiid is an MVP.
	 who? The person who is always injured lol
	 yeah the person who's always injured is the MVP because the team don't make the playoffs without him. Do you even think before typing?
	 don’t deserve mvp if you’re hardly available lol shut up casual
	 embid played just as much in this game as his playoff career
	 yet you're the very type who's against players taking load management. Who's a casual here?
	 very type ?? What is even that .. looks like you were a casual at school yeah
	 lmao I'll really not take English lessons from Americans/Australians 😂😂 get real with yourself.
	 … No! He isn‘t!
	 joker should of won it the last 4 years
	 will Nuggets be as bad as the Sixers if Joker gets injured?
	 they would be good point
	 He won't be MVP this season...he's missed too many games to qualify.
	 obviously
	" As you said ""is"", as opposed to ""was""..."
	 isn't he the reigning MVP? 😂😂 I'd make good money giving private lessons on English in the USA
	 Good luck.
	He has no skills at all! He literally plays like a 10 Day contract player
	 goat tier hating on a post showing he had a triple double and almost 20 rebounds as a guard wtf 😂
	
	 joking I hope. It's called effort.
	 still dropping a crazy triple double statline
	 Haters are extra mad this evening.
	 That he plays like a 10-day contract player is the best thing about him.
	 hate much?  Hart is a human tornado, and a real dogg!  Go Knicks!!!
	
	 But if lebron gets those numbers, he's the goat right?
	 he's pe4fectly skilled for what the knicks need. Ultimately role player. Total dog and gamer. Yea needs to get better at shooting. But he brings max effort and energy and pumps guys up. 
	 Just what is needed facts!!!
	 joking I hope?
	 just accept the loss my guy
	 even idiots are entitled to their own opinion.
	 He's been one of the best offensive rebounders for years. Hustle guy with a high bball IQ.
	 stfu u sound silly
	 you couldn’t even make it on to a g league team so stfu! These are the best basketball players in the world
	 yet you’re at home and he’s on a plane to his next game. Ironic
	
	 if Hart is a 10 day contract player, what does that make Philly?
	 u mad?
	 perhaps basketball isn't for you. Try ballet?
	 yea you're right man! A guy who's been in the league for 7 years getting 29 mpg definitely has no skills. The NBA loves to play guys who are bad for no reason. You should go try out to show us how real skill would look. 🙂
	 u can't no basketball saying that
	 you dont know ball
	 meanwhile your a cuck dressed as Spider-Man
	Lol the other day sixers won 79-73, this tien time scored the same amount but knicks scored 33 more
	 knicks had a bad shooting night. Tonight they didn't. And got og back. If you've been paying attention. Og may be the most i.portant player in the NBA. Cause him on the knicks. Only one game has been close really.... knicks need Randle to have a real shot at a chio, but og and mitch may be more important overall.
	 They turned back the clock three decades
	Josh hart has completely revitalized his career. Hard to believe he’s had 19 boards at guard when it’s the same guy who was posterized so badly I thought he would need therapy
	Tibbs should’ve let him get his 20th rebound
	19 rebounds impressive
	Funny how none knicks fans on this post haten josh hart that's crazy wild to me but salute to hart tho what a game tonight
	  wym? I don't understand your comment. Knicks fans are hating on hart? Or you saying haters from other fan bases are hating on hart?
	 Homeboy said josh has no skills just tried to play him he's the hater
	  oh absolutely.  Don't think he's a knicks fan though.
	 Nope he's not just a hater
	In a 27 point win, Hart still plays 39 minutes… Thibs won’t stop until everyone is injured
	76ers scored only 3 more points from their name to 79 on the night. WOW! 😂
	Knicks might end up in third or fourth place in the eastern conference when the regular season ends.
	Should get 6th player of the year, so underrated
	Embid had this team considered championship caliber lmao
	Now they felt the Harden trade.
	⛳What sport is represented by this sign?⛳👈
	The stats in the caption belong to Brunson though
	Former Laker player LeBron effect 👍💪💪💪💪
	Let’s go NYKnicks
	79 points back to back games for the sixers
	Hart hustles every play. We need more players like him in the NBA
	That's a big game lota boards for a 6'4 guard or undersized small forward he's definitely a keeper
	He plays with hart
	That defense is insane!!
	We still need Mitch for the playoffs
	Boardman gets paid 💪🏾
	The real number 3 of the Knicks is John starks that boy could shoot foul shots
	Josh Hart put up a performance
	 when I want him to do 5 rebounds he gets none lmao
	 fucking demon picks for assist &amp; rebounds lmaooo
	 je l'aime beaucoup lui !
	Very easy win for the Knicks tonight. Good to have OG back. Knicks are the best defensive team in the league. Once this team gets back fully healthy,they’re gonna be scary good BING BONGGGGGGGGG 🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽
	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
	 why don't you message her directly on her private Page 
	That’s the Knicks I know
	 Hi how are you
	The OG Anunoby effect.
	 someone on Reddit said Sixers are just pistons with Embiid
	 RIP Philly
	Lift? Or blowout. The sixers are terrible.  Your local high-school team would beat them. Good thing they spent 8 years losing on purpose, drafting injured players, salary dumping....etc it's all working out for them in the end ! Worst owners in pro sports that Noone talks about for some reason. Just complete shit.  Call it a year and raise the ticket prices again.  Then wonder why we don't show up
	I hope this team knocks out Celtics.
	What a shame that this kind of players used to wear the purple and yellow 🥺 and now shinning with other teams
	So philly decided to continue laying bricks...😂
	Damn he did that??? Lol
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs New York Knicks
	Such an awful team to watch going no where in this league with that style
	This dude every played for the Lakers??
	😆 79 points.  How low can you go
	pls pay this man more...he deserved it
	 of course yea
	So many blowouts
	 huh!!
	Sixers fell all the way off
	 I ain't gonna lie bro, your Knicks are starting to look pretty scary. My Magic are putting it together as well but you guys look totally different since the OG trade
	 y’all been sleeping on us the past couple seasons. We been developing
	 yeah Jalen Brunson is a game changer for real. People been sleeping on us too lol we're ahead of schedule ourself lol when y'all are good the NBA is better so I'm all for it! Keeps us on our toes
	 that damn Josh Hart nothing to sleep on either
	Bruh, 19 boards!?
	Triple Double Kings
	What happen to maxey?
	And he's 6'4
	 your peloton guy
	19 boards as a guard, ain’t no bigs in the paint they running down court tryna get a bucket
	So funny ppl saying he got no skill ect no nothing bout basketball...sad cunts,..you don't get 20p 19r 10a without having a bball high IQ n skill so seriously shut the fuk up
	Come on embiid we need you 🥲
