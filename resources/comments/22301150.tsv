	Wow, Fred VanVleet was absolutely on fire!  37 points, that's insane!  Congrats to the Rockets on the home win!  Also, well-played Smith Jr. and Thompson, your contributions definitely made a difference. Looking forward to seeing more great games.

	I don't know what Toronto was thinking about getting rid of this guy for, I think it was a great loss altogether as now we got one of the worst teams in the NBA LOL
