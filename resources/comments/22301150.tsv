	Rockets making a late run for playins
	
	 they’ve been eliminated for like a week now 😂
	 best they can do undefeated rest of the way is 42 wins. Warriors can lose out and end with 44 wins. Lakers could lose the rest and end with 45
	 they’re eliminated but they can still end the season with a winning season.
	It’s a lil to late Fred we needed this 5 games ago 🤦🏽‍♂️🚀

	Wow, Fred VanVleet was absolutely on fire!  37 points, that's insane!  Congrats to the Rockets on the home win!  Also, well-played Smith Jr. and Thompson, your contributions definitely made a difference. Looking forward to seeing more great games.
