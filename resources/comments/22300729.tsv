	Congrats celtics ..get winner in the game
	sad to see white didn't make the ASG this year. he performed well from the start of the season, and he is one of the reason that the #celtics top the NBA right now 🙂
	Porzingis 🔥🔥🔥🔥
	Derrick White
	D White should have been selected to the All-Star team. He’s been the Celtics most consistent player all season! 
	Is this the nba now. Filling it up with 14 points 3 rebounds 1.5 assists and a whiff on a block.
	Having a superb year
	Love DWHITE!! ☘🏀💚
