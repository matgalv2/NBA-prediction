TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The best center when healthy
	🤣
	Pistons should’ve been demoted to the G League this season,whole team,whole staff.
	Michael William Cassidy Wow...They'll get better.
	Embiid is the real 2024 MVP ! A full offensive and defensive player
	Bill Elvis Yell I like Embiid game
	The best player in the league, pick up just where he left it.
	Gentry Roberts EMBIITCH can only play when it doesn't count
	Que des victoires depuis son retour 0 défaites 
	Such haters on here. If he was on yall team it would be crickets
	Melissa Moonblatt no it wouldn’t I wouldn’t want someone so fragile that chokes in the 2nd round every year
	Oscar Rodriguez G gtfoh
	🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Oscar Rodriguez G I didn’t ask you either. He’s still the best player in the league either way
	😂
	Angel Dela Cruz joker may be better but embiid is pretty damm good
	Angel Dela Cruz you obviously haven't watched the Jokic/Embiid head to head matchups.  Jokic came nowhere close to owning him
	Keenan Walker facts didn’t embiid drop like 45 on him
	Melissa Moonblatt yeah he did.  If anything Embiid was owning him.  He's too big and too skilled for Jokic

	He really makes the difference. Sixers without him wouldn't make the playoff.
	MVP IN THE BOULDING!
	Pistons have tied their record for most losses in franchise history (16-66) in the 1979-80 season so they have to win out to avoid having the worst record in franchise history🏀
	6 dubs in a row 🙌🏽
	Karen Rose that's lovely. 
	I can't believe they even let the Pistons get 100
	MVP MVP MVP ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Embiid
	I knew the 76ers would win, the pistons are so difficult to win
	At least the Lions had a good season.
	Mvp
	There's no way the Pistons make the play-in tournament now.
	😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
	🔥🔥
	Detroit tried hard
	Since JE is back, it really explains how much the Sixers are dependent on Embiid. They need him on the court for survival. More power to you
	Best player in the league when healthy and it’s not even close
	Jack Winchcomb

	Angel Dela Cruz
	🤣
	😉
	🤣
	Angel Dela Cruz are you ready for your yearly embiid choke job playoff entertainment? I'm sure embiid is ready 
	😮‍💨
	Joel Embiid
	Joel Embiid
	How many free throws did he get? 🤔
	Michelle Dean look it up, youre already online
	Erik Lamar
	Michelle Dean You don't know how to count Michelle? C'mon you're too old already.
	Michelle Dean SGA got 20 against the Kings. That's how they play when nobody can defend them.
	Michelle Dean part of basketball why does it matter??
	Michelle Dean enough. You don't want him to take them, don't foul him. Simple.
	Michelle Dean dudes averaging 35 pts on 53% fg% and 11 rebounds per game
	👇
	Michelle Dean How many times were dudes who couldn't guard him under the basket grabbing on him? 
	Michelle Dean thank you for your comment you can now reach me on my link below
	Wow dominated the pistons.
	Embiid better than europeans 👍
	Joel Embiid shouldn't be playing for the 76ers; he can't win the NBA championship with them. He should be playing for the dominant teams such as The Lakers, the Boston Celtics, the Golden State Worriors, the Denver Nuggets, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Miami Heats. These are favourite teams to win the NBA Championship every season.
	What a dominant performance! Wait is that the Pistons,!?
	"Juan Felipe He does it against "" EVERYBODY!"""
	Well okay, but hopefully he doesnt choke this time in the playoffs.
	When #Embiid is there #76ers are safe.! Which he wasn’t injured.!
	Best big man
	"Things are kinda tough at especially this time of the year so I'm gifting 5 grands to the first 10 people to message me with ""TOUGH"" let's spread love and end inhumanity ❤️"
	Basket keeper 💓💓👍
	... he's back for sure
	Oh you guys got it right this time

	NBA Faces Familiar Dilemma
	On December 13, 1983, the Pistons and Nuggets combined for an NBA-record 370 points as Detroit won. 
	Vs the pistons lol.
