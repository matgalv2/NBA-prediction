	The best center when healthy
	 if you gotta say when healthy he’s not the best cause the other guy is always healthy 🤣
	 best Center until Playoffs
	Pistons should’ve been demoted to the G League this season,whole team,whole staff.
	 Wow...They'll get better.
	Embiid is the real 2024 MVP ! A full offensive and defensive player
	 Yell I like Embiid game
	Such haters on here. If he was on yall team it would be crickets
	 no it wouldn’t I wouldn’t want someone so fragile that chokes in the 2nd round every year
	 gtfoh
	 notice how you didn’t say I was wrong 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 I didn’t ask you either. He’s still the best player in the league either way
	 They hate him coz their best player owned that guy😂

	The best player in the league, pick up just where he left it.
	 EMBIITCH can only play when it doesn't count
	Que des victoires depuis son retour 0 défaites 
	He really makes the difference. Sixers without him wouldn't make the playoff.
	I can't believe they even let the Pistons get 100
	MVP IN THE BOULDING!
	6 dubs in a row 🙌🏽
	Pistons have tied their record for most losses in franchise history (16-66) in the 1979-80 season so they have to win out to avoid having the worst record in franchise history🏀
	I knew the 76ers would win, the pistons are so difficult to win
	MVP MVP MVP ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Embiid
	There's no way the Pistons make the play-in tournament now.
	At least the Lions had a good season.
	Mvp
	😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
	 🔥🔥
	Detroit tried hard
	Best player in the league when healthy and it’s not even close
	Since JE is back, it really explains how much the Sixers are dependent on Embiid. They need him on the court for survival. More power to you
	Joel Embiid
	Joel Embiid
	How many free throws did he get? 🤔
	Wow dominated the pistons.
	Embiid better than europeans 👍
	What a dominant performance! Wait is that the Pistons,!?
	When  is there  are safe.! Which he wasn’t injured.!
	Joel Embiid shouldn't be playing for the 76ers; he can't win the NBA championship with them. He should be playing for the dominant teams such as The Lakers, the Boston Celtics, the Golden State Worriors, the Denver Nuggets, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Miami Heats. These are favourite teams to win the NBA Championship every season.
	Things are kinda tough at especially this time of the year so I'm gifting 5 grands to the first 10 people to message me with 
	Best big man
	Basket keeper 💓💓👍
	... he's back for sure
	 scary hours time to take over the east 🤫
	Oh you guys got it right this time

	NBA Faces Familiar Dilemma
	On December 13, 1983, the Pistons and Nuggets combined for an NBA-record 370 points as Detroit won.
