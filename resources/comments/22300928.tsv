	T.J. You're the best, so glad you're on the pacers team.
	I was at the game, and was pleasantly surprised to see so many Haliburton jerseys. It was incredibly exciting to watch the Pacers play in person! Gritty win, especially being undermanned. Praying for Mathurin.
	Compared to Michael Jordan, who is more powerful in terms of James' versatility on the court and his impact on the team as a whole?
