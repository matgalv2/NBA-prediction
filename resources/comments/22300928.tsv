	T.J. You're the best, so glad you're on the pacers team.
	I was at the game, and was pleasantly surprised to see so many Haliburton jerseys. It was incredibly exciting to watch the Pacers play in person! Gritty win, especially being undermanned. Praying for Mathurin.

	The Magic would’ve won by 50 if Kai Sotto played 😤 <a class=
