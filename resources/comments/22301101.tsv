	The decision that he isnt an all star will be remembered as the worst decision in the whole nba history
	“Why is he stat padding! He just playing for stats” crazy I don’t see one comment like that, but when Westbrook was hittin triple doubles for yearly averages, that was every other comment. Smh 😂😂😂
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion 💪
	Congratulations to Sabonis and Kings team on the victory!
	 oh yeah
	Most underrated player in the NBA. Should be talked about more!
	 you know we’re big Saboner guys
	Everyone talks about Jokic as the best European player ever… why do people forget how great this guys (Sabonis) father was pre nba and during… 
	Clippers showing their true playoff form...Also don't snub sabonis,he deserves to be an all star, hopefully next year.
	1 assist shy of a triple double while scoring over 20 and grabbing 20 boards is very impressive
	Lucky for the KINGS they won lots of games early in the season i thought they’re out of contention 👎🏼
	That’s why I’ve been a fan of his since Indy he’s got to be one of the most consistent players ever never worried about what he’s gonna do it’s always every body else
	Wild to think he turned into this after the Thunder let him go.
	The Notorious!
	He Knows &amp; so do the Players !
	He is getting better each year
	Oh mamaah men😎😆 (The Lithuanian Sensation) strikes and saves the day for the kings😅 he dominants my Croatian big boy Zubac on the middle oh come on Mamaah men i know Jonas Valanciunas my big broo will know this😎😁✌
	Tough shooting night for the Clips
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Sacramento Kings
	California Clash then Congrats to Sacramento Kings
	Somehow, not an All-Star
	Absolutely amazing player
	
	Good luck 🍀
	Nice Home Win For The Kings 💜🖤
	It’s the end of the Clippers 
	No Kawhi. It would have been different.
	Domamtas Sabonis never slow down
	The amount of triple doubles he’s missed by one is crazy.
	amazing!
	Soft as a pillow.  🥹🙄😆. Sacramento is adorable. 👶🏼😀
	The choking Clippers keep losing
