TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	The decision that he isnt an all star will be remembered as the worst decision in the whole nba history
SAC	“Why is he stat padding! He just playing for stats” crazy I don’t see one comment like that, but when Westbrook was hittin triple doubles for yearly averages, that was every other comment. Smh 😂😂😂
SAC	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion 💪
SAC	Congratulations to Sabonis and Kings team on the victory!
SAC	Arsenas Sarkisianc oh yeah
SAC	Most underrated player in the NBA. Should be talked about more!
SAC	Ryan Jacobs you know we’re big Saboner guys
SAC	Steve Zinelli the best!
SAC	Everyone talks about Jokic as the best European player ever… why do people forget how great this guys (Sabonis) father was pre nba and during…
LAC	Clippers showing their true playoff form...Also don't snub sabonis,he deserves to be an all star, hopefully next year.
SAC	1 assist shy of a triple double while scoring over 20 and grabbing 20 boards is very impressive
SAC	That’s why I’ve been a fan of his since Indy he’s got to be one of the most consistent players ever never worried about what he’s gonna do it’s always every body else
SAC	Lucky for the KINGS they won lots of games early in the season i thought they’re out of contention 👎🏼
SAC	He Knows &amp; so do the Players !
SAC	The Notorious!
LAC	Tough shooting night for the Clips
SAC	Wild to think he turned into this after the Thunder let him go.
SAC	Oh mamaah men😎😆 (The Lithuanian Sensation) strikes and saves the day for the kings😅 he dominants my Croatian big boy Zubac on the middle oh come on Mamaah men i know Jonas Valanciunas my big broo will know this😎😁✌
SAC	He is getting better each year

SAC	Nice Home Win For The Kings 💜🖤
LAC	It’s the end of the Clippers
LAC	No Kawhi. It would have been different.
SAC	Guess we just gonna ignore no Kevin Huerter or Malik Monk huh?
SAC	Jentin Joe they still had Sabonis and Fox.
SAC	Kevin Estrella and the clippers still had George, Harden, Westbrook and Zubac.
LAC	Jentin Joe thats y it shocks me that they lost.. Zubac cant stop Sabonis.. i think Lue should have started Theis..
SAC	The amount of triple doubles he’s missed by one is crazy.
SAC	Domamtas Sabonis never slow down
SAC	amazing!
