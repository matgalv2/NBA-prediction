	Yeah Celtics!  Another great win tonight in Chicago!  That’s no bull!
	Boston will be the 2023-2024 NBA Champion! 💚🍀
	Not mvp selection at all… great player but never takes opportunity to be that dominant player
	Yes boston has been a good great team since tatum and brown arrived, but the question every playoff can they be consistent, do they have defensive mind to beat heat, knicks or milwaukee. Lets see
	Good for elimination...😃😃😃😃😃😃
	Question is can Boston make it to the finals and win it all don't care what they do in the regular season will this be their year no hate just saying
	Boston Celtics!!! 🏀⛹🏿‍♀️💪🏾🍀🏆♥️
	My favorite player in the game right now… Still a Knicks fan tho..
	Win ☘❤
	The haters are now crying because they bet on the opponents of Boston thinking they can grow their $1 hahahahhaha GTFOH Peasants, the celtics will win 2k24 Finals and Tatum will be Finals MVP
	Let’s go
	They are going to be playing a lot of meaningless basketball in April. 6 more wins and they clinch the best record in the NBA. The Boston Jays have never been a 1 seed before... Should be a great playoff!
	I just love ❤️ this JT
	Unpopular opinion all the people criticizing Tatum for not wining a championship are mostly the same people who call LeBron the goat even though LeBron first years he couldn't win the big game either 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the double standard
	They have added Jrue Holiday, Derrick White as veterans.. so they have a 100 % chance to get the championship
	From memory there has only been one 10+ win streak this season (by the Celtics) and we're about to enter the 2nd one while resting half our stars every game
	One more win and we are assure of East HCA, 6 wins for the over-all HCA…
	This is the Boston Celtics 8th streak they’ve been on all season. It’s the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen
	 feels like they go on a 10 game winning streak after every single loss
	 yeah I know eh aha it’s been great to watch
	9th win in a row. Just wow..
	No doubt, they are a good team....but i will just wait till playoffs begin
	All this hard work to be beaten by the Heat again 🤣🤣
	Good  game hope they can win playoffs and finals
	I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t win the last 11 games let’s go get banner 18
	Clearly that’s traveling
	Best in NBA☘️
	Playoffs will speak for themselves, teams will have more time to study teams and exploit there weaknesses, one injury can change everything.
	Sam Curry..😲😁
	Are game issued jerseys stitched these days or heat sealed? They always look hear sealed on camera.
	Now Milwaukee just has to lose tonight and that #1 seed is ours.
	They can get at least 60 wins
	Celtics and nuggets will face the finals
	get ready for playoffs
	3 wins from 60
	Bravo
	yeyyy, Celtics!
	👏👏👏
	First round exit , Tatum chokes just like the bruins do my teams will never win again
