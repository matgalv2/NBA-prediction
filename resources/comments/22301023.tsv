TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
BOS	Yeah Celtics!  Another great win tonight in Chicago!  That’s no bull!
BOS	Boston will be the 2023-2024 NBA Champion! 💚🍀
BOS	Not mvp selection at all… great player but never takes opportunity to be that dominant player
BOS	Good for elimination...😃😃😃😃😃😃
BOS	Yes boston has been a good great team since tatum and brown arrived, but the question every playoff can they be consistent, do they have defensive mind to beat heat, knicks or milwaukee. Lets see
BOS	Boston Celtics!!! 🏀⛹🏿‍♀️💪🏾🍀🏆♥️
BOS	Question is can Boston make it to the finals and win it all don't care what they do in the regular season will this be their year no hate just saying
BOS	The haters are now crying because they bet on the opponents of Boston thinking they can grow their $1 hahahahhaha GTFOH Peasants, the celtics will win 2k24 Finals and Tatum will be Finals MVP
BOS	My favorite player in the game right now… Still a Knicks fan tho..
BOS	Win ☘❤
BOS	Let’s go
BOS	I just love ❤️ this JT
BOS	They are going to be playing a lot of meaningless basketball in April. 6 more wins and they clinch the best record in the NBA. The Boston Jays have never been a 1 seed before... Should be a great playoff!
BOS	They have added Jrue Holiday, Derrick White as veterans.. so they have a 100 % chance to get the championship
BOS	Unpopular opinion all the people criticizing Tatum for not wining a championship are mostly the same people who call LeBron the goat even though LeBron first years he couldn't win the big game either 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the double standard
BOS	One more win and we are assure of East HCA, 6 wins for the over-all HCA…
BOS	From memory there has only been one 10+ win streak this season (by the Celtics) and we're about to enter the 2nd one while resting half our stars every game
BOS	This is the Boston Celtics 8th streak they’ve been on all season. It’s the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen
BOS	No doubt, they are a good team....but i will just wait till playoffs begin
BOS	9th win in a row. Just wow..
BOS	Good  game hope they can win playoffs and finals
BOS	All this hard work to be beaten by the Heat again 🤣🤣
BOS	Kevin Myers You must be new to basketball coz the Heat DON’T own the Celtics. Sure they won last year but you clowns seem to have amnesia about games before that. Lay off the crack
	Clearly that’s traveling
BOS	I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t win the last 11 games let’s go get banner 18
	Playoffs will speak for themselves, teams will have more time to study teams and exploit there weaknesses, one injury can change everything.
BOS	Now Milwaukee just has to lose tonight and that #1 seed is ours.
BOS	Best in NBA☘️
	Are game issued jerseys stitched these days or heat sealed? They always look hear sealed on camera.
BOS	They can get at least 60 wins
BOS	Celtics and nuggets will face the finals
	Sam Curry..😲😁
BOS	get ready for playoffs
BOS	3 wins from 60
BOS	Bravo
BOS	yeyyy, Celtics!

BOS	I read all the comments a lot of haters are crying 😂😂

BOS	They’re choke once it’s play offs
BOS	Just restin for the playoffs 🥱
	Boston Celtics Vs Chicago Bulls

BOS	All the best
	"Things are kinda tough at especially this time of the year so I'm gifting 5 grands to the first 10 people to message me with ""TOUGH"" let's spread love and end inhumanity ❤️"
