TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Yeah Celtics!  Another great win tonight in Chicago!  That’s no bull!
	Boston will be the 2023-2024 NBA Champion! 💚🍀
	Not mvp selection at all… great player but never takes opportunity to be that dominant player
	Good for elimination...😃😃😃😃😃😃
	Yes boston has been a good great team since tatum and brown arrived, but the question every playoff can they be consistent, do they have defensive mind to beat heat, knicks or milwaukee. Lets see
	Boston Celtics!!! 🏀⛹🏿‍♀️💪🏾🍀🏆♥️
	Question is can Boston make it to the finals and win it all don't care what they do in the regular season will this be their year no hate just saying
	The haters are now crying because they bet on the opponents of Boston thinking they can grow their $1 hahahahhaha GTFOH Peasants, the celtics will win 2k24 Finals and Tatum will be Finals MVP
	My favorite player in the game right now… Still a Knicks fan tho..
	Win ☘❤
	Let’s go
	I just love ❤️ this JT
	They are going to be playing a lot of meaningless basketball in April. 6 more wins and they clinch the best record in the NBA. The Boston Jays have never been a 1 seed before... Should be a great playoff!
	They have added Jrue Holiday, Derrick White as veterans.. so they have a 100 % chance to get the championship
	Unpopular opinion all the people criticizing Tatum for not wining a championship are mostly the same people who call LeBron the goat even though LeBron first years he couldn't win the big game either 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the double standard
	One more win and we are assure of East HCA, 6 wins for the over-all HCA…
	From memory there has only been one 10+ win streak this season (by the Celtics) and we're about to enter the 2nd one while resting half our stars every game
	This is the Boston Celtics 8th streak they’ve been on all season. It’s the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen
	No doubt, they are a good team....but i will just wait till playoffs begin
	9th win in a row. Just wow..
	Good  game hope they can win playoffs and finals
	All this hard work to be beaten by the Heat again 🤣🤣
	Kevin Myers You must be new to basketball coz the Heat DON’T own the Celtics. Sure they won last year but you clowns seem to have amnesia about games before that. Lay off the crack
	Clearly that’s traveling
	I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t win the last 11 games let’s go get banner 18
	Playoffs will speak for themselves, teams will have more time to study teams and exploit there weaknesses, one injury can change everything.
	Now Milwaukee just has to lose tonight and that #1 seed is ours.
	Best in NBA☘️
	Are game issued jerseys stitched these days or heat sealed? They always look hear sealed on camera.
	They can get at least 60 wins
	Celtics and nuggets will face the finals
	Sam Curry..😲😁
	get ready for playoffs
	3 wins from 60
	Bravo
	yeyyy, Celtics!
	👏👏👏
	First round exit , Tatum chokes just like the bruins do my teams will never win again
	The Titanium

	9th straight. Let's keep balling and winning guys!🍀❤️🏆
	I read all the comments a lot of haters are crying 😂😂
	Sorry but I would rather have D White take the last shot in a
	They’re choke once it’s play offs
	Just restin for the playoffs 🥱
	Boston Celtics Vs Chicago Bulls
	Good stuff
	All the best
