	Clippers the best team 2024!!!!
	He really did this without Harden, 11/12  field goal. Sounds like a clear message.
	The Bulls were simply outclassed by a team that scores at will.  The injuries are piling up for Chicago-Williams, White, LaVine, Ball, etc.  I'm happy with last night's effort though.  Javon Carter is ramping up his game.  Andre showed some fire.  Caruso is shooting threes in rhythm.  There is reason for optimism.
	Nice work Paul!!
	He cannot shoot well vs strong defense team
