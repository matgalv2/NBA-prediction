	Will LaMelo ever be healthy for a full year is the biggest question mark for the Hornets future, that and we need a new coach. Like, yesterday.
	 thats just something you have to deal with because bro is really good when healthy
	 I don’t know why they be letting Steve Clifford coach lol
	 if we were going to fire him, it would have been at all-star. We all know he’s gone after this year and by god if we can get Budenholzer… Ill be cautiously optimistic
