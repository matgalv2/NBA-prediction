	San Antonio Spurs Vs Dallas Mavericks
	So Gaford and Washington were good for Dallas sports logically looking stupid now calling the trade the biggest l of the trade deadline
	Wemby literally IS the Spurs at this point

	Those are Filipino Kai Sotto numbers 💯 They also are both left handed 🔥💯 In other words, Kai Sotto of the Philippines is the asian version of Domantas Sabonis 😎 Therefore,  Kai Sotto can help any NBA teams like the Detroit Pistons win the championship … Wyświetl więcej
	John Lester Tayros Kai sotto will never play in the NBA... No hype job can change that
	"Things are kinda tough atm especially this time of the year so l'm gifting 8 grands to the first 10 people to message me with ""TOUGH"" let's spread love and end inhumanity.❤️🏦"
