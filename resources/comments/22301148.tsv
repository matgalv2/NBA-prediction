TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Best game of his career
	Let’s be real Boston were 15 games up heading into the game doubt they were too motivated
	🙄
	The next 5 years
	My favorite Eastern Conference player!
	congrats 2024 nba champion pat bev!
	Arvin Caparas 
	Celtics just chilling waiting for play-offs.
	Matt Nolan no, they're already in peak playoff choking mode
	😂 u act like the Celtics even tried that game and you didn’t lose 4 straight to bad teams before that. I’d like to see the whole bucks team shoot like that in the playoffs, but Miami will be taking them out first round again.
	Jacob McAvoy and when Miami gets the 8 seed and knocks Boston out in the first round, your temper tantrum is gonna be even wilder than this one
	Dan Torres definitely won’t happen to Boston but definitely could to Milwaukee 76ers might even take milwaukee
	😁
	Dan Torres Boston Isn’t Milwaukee. Not happening. It’s gonna be the best thing ever to watch Milwaukee go back to back first round exits though.
	Jacob McAvoy you're right, Jfrauds choke and can't get chips like this Bucks team can
	Celtic already in playoffs mode 😂
	Still better😂 look at the record difference they needed this win more than we did 😎🍀we rested a 1 starter &amp; Al some they should have but pray Giannis is ok
	Respect that! Like I said, bro can score if he wants.
	Boston flying back home up 14 games on the east with a bug 😃
	Still need to get rid of doc rivers
	Only 2 free throws the entire game combined.
	Eastern Conference Finals collision course as long as Miami don’t F it up like usual
	Congratulations Bucks
	Future NBA Star Pat Bev
	Boston championship
	Here comes the next 5 years of Pat Bev😅
	That’s what’s up Pat!

	They let Beverley play like that
	Boston Celtics Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	The next 5 minutes are definitely his
	Bucks beat Celtics
	😳
	Pat Bev is the Lebron James of Lance Stephensons.
	Imagine having 62 wins just to lose to Doc Rivers 😩😭💀🤣
	Its good
	He’s so good he spent his energy trying to clown a (checks notes) third string center that was in the g-league last year? Ok bud. 😉
	Boston being the best team, but always losing to Bucks...
	CELTICS BECAME THE FIRST TEAM IN NBA HISTORY WITH ZERO FREE-THROWS IN A GAME 😂 😆
	Battle??? Na Celtics are in stay healthy mode...
	So, Celtics stayed healthy, but Bucks lost Giannis. So, IDK about who won the game..
	lol when the refs aint whistling...
	How injured Giannis?
	The Celtics will probably win the championship 🏆 this season. They have been putting in electrifying and sensational performance since game 1.
	A muscular man
	Patrick Beverly Hills

	PaBev is the new Dame ⌚ 😆😂
	Y'all can't believe the nba isn't fixed right ? I mean look how man shot sabonis took last game . Joker does it all the time too . Nothing is ever said but let a bench player have a bad game and he gets called out for cheating haha .
