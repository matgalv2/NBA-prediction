	Best game of his career
	 lol😅
	No way, he can actually play Basketball??
	Let’s be real Boston were 15 games up heading into the game doubt they were too motivated
	 yeah, especially after the starters were ran off the court last time in the Mil.
	 Ye they weren't motivated the last 2 times they came in Milwaukee as well, hence the blowout
	 they folded like clean sheets
	 facts. Meaningless game.
	 that’s why they keep coming up short in the playoffs. No killer instinct 🤦🏻‍♂️
	 remember when miami had the worst record and threw Boston and Mil in the thrash can
	 that's why they played Tatum and brown deep into the 4th huh🙄
	 Boston fans just cant give credits to other team
	The next 5 years
	My favorite Eastern Conference player!
	congrats 2024 nba champion pat bev!
	Celtics just chilling waiting for play-offs.
	"Matt Nolan agree! That’s what we waiting on the remaining games means nothing we have been clinched playoffs spot &amp; have home court advantage throughout playoffs best record playing on the rode &amp; 35-3 at home we haven’t lost a game at home to eastern c… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 no, they're already in peak playoff choking mode
	 😂 u act like the Celtics even tried that game and you didn’t lose 4 straight to bad teams before that. I’d like to see the whole bucks team shoot like that in the playoffs, but Miami will be taking them out first round again.
	 and when Miami gets the 8 seed and knocks Boston out in the first round, your temper tantrum is gonna be even wilder than this one
	 definitely won’t happen to Boston but definitely could to Milwaukee 76ers might even take milwaukee
	 it's gonna be the best thing ever when Boston flames out in the 1st round 😁
	 Boston Isn’t Milwaukee. Not happening. It’s gonna be the best thing ever to watch Milwaukee go back to back first round exits though.
	 you're right, Jfrauds choke and can't get chips like this Bucks team can
	 They sure are! Right on schedule for another miserable series loss to Miami
	Celtic already in playoffs mode 😂
	Lanang Putra Choke Playoff mode
	 so are the bucks 🤷🏻‍♂️
	 meaningless game
	 So is the Bucks their second, and your point is ?
	 y do y’all alway make an excuse for the Celtics win the bucks beat them ￼
	 62-17 with a few games left I’m sure the Celtics are so worried 😏
	Still better😂 look at the record difference they needed this win more than we did 😎🍀we rested a 1 starter &amp; Al some they should have but pray Giannis is ok
	Respect that! Like I said, bro can score if he wants.
	Boston flying back home up 14 games on the east with a bug 😃
	Still need to get rid of doc rivers
	Only 2 free throws the entire game combined.
	Kungodzidzimukira basi? Kuluza ndi timatimu tosadziwika uko, mkudzayipitsa usiku wa Celtics. 😂
	Congratulations Bucks
	Eastern Conference Finals collision course as long as Miami don’t F it up like usual
	Future NBA Star Pat Bev

	Imagine having 62 wins just to lose to Doc Rivers 😩😭💀🤣
	Its good
	He’s so good he spent his energy trying to clown a (checks notes) third string center that was in the g-league last year? Ok bud. 😉
	Battle??? Na Celtics are in stay healthy mode...
	So, Celtics stayed healthy, but Bucks lost Giannis. So, IDK about who won the game..
	CELTICS BECAME THE FIRST TEAM IN NBA HISTORY WITH ZERO FREE-THROWS IN A GAME 😂 😆
	Boston being the best team, but always losing to Bucks...
	I see a lot of excuses, is that something typical for Boston fans?
	lol when the refs aint whistling...
	How injured Giannis?
	The Celtics will probably win the championship 🏆 this season. They have been putting in electrifying and sensational performance since game 1.
	Beverly is the GOAT
	A muscular man
	Imagine losing to the lowly 
	Patrick Beverly Hills

	Both teams chokers and inconsistent in playoffs
