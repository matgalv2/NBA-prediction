	🙄

MIL	My favorite Eastern Conference player!
MIL	congrats 2024 nba champion pat bev!
	Arvin Caparas 
BOS	Celtics just chilling waiting for play-offs.
BOS	Matt Nolan no, they're already in peak playoff choking mode
MIL	😂 u act like the Celtics even tried that game and you didn’t lose 4 straight to bad teams before that. I’d like to see the whole bucks team shoot like that in the playoffs, but Miami will be taking them out first round again.
BOS	Jacob McAvoy and when Miami gets the 8 seed and knocks Boston out in the first round, your temper tantrum is gonna be even wilder than this one
MIL	Dan Torres definitely won’t happen to Boston but definitely could to Milwaukee 76ers might even take milwaukee
	😁
BOS	Dan Torres Boston Isn’t Milwaukee. Not happening. It’s gonna be the best thing ever to watch Milwaukee go back to back first round exits though.
MIL	Jacob McAvoy you're right, Jfrauds choke and can't get chips like this Bucks team can
BOS	Celtic already in playoffs mode 😂
BOS	Still better😂 look at the record difference they needed this win more than we did 😎🍀we rested a 1 starter &amp; Al some they should have but pray Giannis is ok
	Respect that! Like I said, bro can score if he wants.
BOS	Boston flying back home up 14 games on the east with a bug 😃
	Still need to get rid of doc rivers
	Only 2 free throws the entire game combined.
	Eastern Conference Finals collision course as long as Miami don’t F it up like usual
MIL	Congratulations Bucks
MIL	Future NBA Star Pat Bev

BOS	Boston being the best team, but always losing to Bucks...
BOS	CELTICS BECAME THE FIRST TEAM IN NBA HISTORY WITH ZERO FREE-THROWS IN A GAME 😂 😆

	So, Celtics stayed healthy, but Bucks lost Giannis. So, IDK about who won the game..
