TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	The hype on the kings beating an energy depleted nuggets was a laugh 😂
	Goran Tomasevic oh really
	Goran Tomasevic is the really an excuse you're giving the world champions?  Cause that's just silly.
	Joe Bou no excuse, just facts
	Goran Tomasevic that's 100% an excuse.
	Joe Bou I’m sure many would agree with me
	Goran Tomasevic y’all still salty 🤣 2-0 👑
	Cody Faria proud of a team that won’t get far in the playoffs 👍
	Goran Tomasevic 2-0 👑
	Cody Faria lol I thought so 🤣
	Goran Tomasevic Lakers was on a back to back too but can still win.
	Terrence McHatten at home the whole time with no travel. Alittle different
	Goran Tomasevic you mean blow out. 💀
	Marc Garcia oh I’m sorry, a tired depleted team can’t have a bad game, just like the kings today
	Goran Tomasevic more excuses. Keep it going.
	Goran Tomasevic hey I'm back. Kings on a back to back. What's the excuse today bud?
	Goran Tomasevic 🤨
	Joe Bou Oi maggot, invest your time in more important things like getting yourself in shape
	Goran Tomasevic lmao!!!!
	Goran Tomasevic imagine commenting that them locking your account. You're a kid bud. I'm sure whatever dojo you're learning in teaches those as values. Classless clown.
	Joe Bou lol my profile has been locked for a year. your the one who’s a kid coming back and remembering a random to message them. It’s what school kids do actually. But nice come back 😂 
	Goran Tomasevic this guy, LOL. You're an athlete but you can't handle a little sports banter without getting your undies in a knot. Grow up bud.
	Goran Tomasevic I'm back
	Luka &gt; SGA and it ain’t even close, but good bounce-back win for OKC.
	Stephen Mi trolllllllllllll
	Theo Rogers this is the NBA page where people talk about the NBA I would hardly call that trolling.
	Jason Cleveland oh no bub. You misunderstood. For anyone to say something so ludicrous....they HAVE to be trolling
OKC	Theo Rogers no one outside of Oklahoma thinks SGA is better than Luka right now.
OKC	Cmon. You can't really believe that
OKC	They been playing basketball forever when is basketball season over
OKC	MVP SGA
	Debbie Ross we see last game vs Doncic😂
	Debbie Ross bro just lost by 40 lmaoooo
OKC	SGA is good he just need to be more HUMBLE… stay humble as a person makes you better what if your not an nba player you just a regular person…
	Dave Dave hes actually a veruly humble dude. What leads you to believe he is not i ask?
	Dave Dave how is he not humble
	Dave Dave More humble? 🤦🏻‍♂️You’re a clown bud. 🤡 Learn how to use a full stop before you speak again.
	Dave Dave you've got to be trolling....or you don't watch. What would ever make you say he's not humble?
	Dave Dave How is he not humble? Watch Luka play, he complains every 30 seconds lol
	Dave Dave I see Shai every game day in person, he is the nicest NBA player you will meet.
	Dave Dave what exactly has he done/said that suggests he's not? It's the fans who are comparing guards.
	Dave Dave he has always been humble, great guy, he needs to in order to lead a young team like OKC
	Dave Dave bruh he don’t even talk 😂
	Love the way this Thunder team playing, SGA one of my favs to watch
	had to turn this game off, was such a bore, no passing the ball or anything even remotely close to defense being played at all
OKC	MVP mode

OKC	Love the way this Thunder team playing, SGA one of my favs to watch
OKC	I got him being the next guy dropping 60
	Kenneth Roach his career high is 44, he kinda needs to reach 50 first and I'm a Thunder fan lol
	Jon Fred Rich Toledo  you’re probably right
	Kenneth Roach he's such an efficiency man and is allergic to scoring 50, but I'm fine with it tho, he leads the NBA in 30-point games this season
	Jon Fred Rich Toledo don’t sleep on efficient ppl…that refuse to take a bunch of shots…just takes one night for them to get motivated.. or add a little fvck it in there system for them to go full blown mamba
	Great win! Cant wait to see the Thunder become legit contenders once again when they draft Deuce Tatum 1st overall in the 2050 NBA DRAFT! 😤
	MVP dude break somebody Ankle Every night 👀
	Hey NBA...next time when you will prepare MVP list don't forget to remember...this is award for best performance. And don't forget that Luka Dončić just proved he's 100x better than SGA and all others. He is No. 1..he is NBA! You just don't see it don't you. Somebody else must be pushed...
	Nice bounce back win for the Thunder, after getting dismantled by Dallas yesterday, losing by 35. Interesting fact, the Thunder have lost 2 games in a row, six times this season, but have yet to lose 3 games in a row. So they're 6-0 after losing back to back games this season.
	Mark Burnett that’s where most of there losses come from lol
	Kelton Loomis yep, 12 of their 17 losses have come from back to back losses. Really strange trend there. And to lose 2 in a row 6 times, but be 6-0 in games to avoid a 3 game losing streak is strange too. They're a streaky team I guess.
	Mark Burnett OKC also plays much better at home only 6 losses at home this season
	Sacramento Kings Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
OKC	Shai-Gilgeous Alexander
OKC	The Lip💋
