TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	DPOY I don't care about team results. This is an individual award and individually he's the best defender in the league.
	 to be fair Gobert leads the league in defensive rating and defensive win shares (as well as the Wolves being the leagues best defensive team)
	 with your logic, jason tatum should be the mvp because he's the best player on the best record team.
	 no it’s not 😂
	Dane Saisell you understand that defensive rating and defensive win shares also have team components that factor into their final value. The fact the Wemby is close to gobert with the worst supporting cast on D speaks more than anything
	" you see, if jokic is the mvp, then team record has nothing to do who the best player is. same as defense, gobert only has a higher defensive rating because of his team. if you see how big of a gap wemby does to the spurs defensive rating w… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 you yourself, if given the chance to make a shot to win 1M Dollars and given the choice to be defended by either wemby or gobert. Who would you choose to defend you?
	 good deflection 😂
	 this isn’t about who you or I believe is better. 
	 thanks for answering the question. it's clear even if you didn't say it directly.
	 don’t get all sensitive just because you couldn’t comprehend what was said and don’t know about some pretty basic basketball concepts 😂
	 yup, 6th best defensive team when he’s on the court, worst in the league when he’s off the court.
	 honestly if Gobert gets it over AD or Wemby it's rigged
	 I agree 💯 it's not about team stats or standings lmao mvp also is individual stats not team stats go Luka MVP
	 I was thinking same
	 they struggled bad in the beginning because if you watched the games they wasn’t really passing wemby the ball like that. Probably didn’t know how to use him because he’s so versatile. But we see now when the ball is in his hands good things happen.

	He’s going to be in the running for MVP and DPOY for the next decade while also having the ability to lead the league in PPG-RPG-BPG. 
	 he never gonna get ppg. He get the points he does now because he takes the majority of the teams shots while on the court. He shoots sub 40% from outside the rim.
	 he’s averaging 21ppg in under 30mpg as a foreigner who entered the league as a 19 year old. 
	 he’s doing that on 45% shooting. That many points in that time period means that they are getting almost no points elsewhere.  He’s not even the best shooter on the team.
	 but he projects as an elite shooter. Good mechanics and no one will be able to contest.

	 except Wemby is the 11th most measurably impactful player league wide this season (Jokic, Luka, Giannis and SGA are the top 4). Who’s the top 4 MVP candidates this season? 
	 impactful how? Making them lose by less?
	 yes 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
	 impact generally refers to wins. Having to make up new standards for a player because he team never wins is the NBA equivalent of a participation trophy.
	 no it doesn’t 😂
	 impact is measured by win shares. But you have to win to have win shares.
	
	 agreed. Gonna be fun to watch for a long time
	The spurs' defensive rating is top tier when he is on the floor. It is not his fault that his team cant keep up. Give him the DPOY

	Jokic almost gets a triple double every night, wemby as a rookie is almost getting a quadruple double every night lol
	The San Antonio Wenbanyama’s are a great team!
	Congratulations to Wembanyama and Spurs team on the victory
	Next season great predic spurs, memphis and houston will have a playoff spot. A more tougher west conference

	He needs to add more rebound this will help the team a lot
	Amongst the DPOY contenders, he is leading in blocks, steals, and deflections. No contest
	Gumby can play definitely gonna be a problem.
	We will see 5-5-5-5-5 stats often in the near future.
	wemby has now tied kevin durant's team wins record during his rookie season so don't bash victor because of spurs' team record.
	Le faltó 3 Reb, 4 asist y 3 block para un cuádruple doble!💪🏻💪🏻
	This could be deadly team if he's got a good teammates
	Without Vassel and Sochan, seems like the Spurs plays a bit better.
	lol these dudes are catching up slowly, next season I reckon they might even get close to the play in and that’s good for the NBA !

	Dpoy Roty Wemby
	Quadruple double average next season!
	And just think he will get better..... heck, we are going to get top 4 draft pick coming up... it's only going to get easier...
	Wemby hit the spot all the time
	Waiting for his quad-double
	He’s definitely getting a quad double in his career
	Mine de rien, ils ne sont pas dernier du classement au global

	He’s going to be in the running for MVP and DPOY for the next decade while also having the ability to lead the league in PPG-RPG-BPG.

	This kid gonna get a quadruple double by next season.
	That's my Wemby 👏
	Wasn’t a fan of his hype, but this dude needs a solid PG and a shooter next to him.
	classement svp
	He's gunna be the only player with a quadruple-double in this era
	He would be a legit DPOY if their record was better but definitely Rookie of the year no cap
	Those records are ludicrous 🤣😮‍💨
	How do the spurs have less wins than the grizzlies ?
	Going to be interesting next season. Theres some interesting centers for the draft.
