	DPOY I don't care about team results. This is an individual award and individually he's the best defender in the league.
	He’s going to be in the running for MVP and DPOY for the next decade while also having the ability to lead the league in PPG-RPG-BPG. 
	The spurs' defensive rating is top tier when he is on the floor. It is not his fault that his team cant keep up. Give him the DPOY
	Jokic almost gets a triple double every night, wemby as a rookie is almost getting a quadruple double every night lol
	The San Antonio Wenbanyama’s are a great team!
	Congratulations to Wembanyama and Spurs team on the victory
	Next season great predic spurs, memphis and houston will have a playoff spot. A more tougher west conference
	There are players in NBA who can match and can exceed Wemby's score, but when it comes to blocks none can catch him or match him. His blocks have become a hallmark and trademarks exclusive. This basketball 🏀 prodigy will go a long way in refining and enhancing the style, class, quality and finess to the game. He will be a household name in the basketball world. Every. God Bless you and keep you physically fit. It's a joy to watch him, irrespective of win or loss.
	He needs to add more rebound this will help the team a lot
	Amongst the DPOY contenders, he is leading in blocks, steals, and deflections. No contest
	wemby has now tied kevin durant's team wins record during his rookie season so don't bash victor because of spurs' team record.
	We will see 5-5-5-5-5 stats often in the near future.
	Without Vassel and Sochan, seems like the Spurs plays a bit better.
	This could be deadly team if he's got a good teammates
	lol these dudes are catching up slowly, next season I reckon they might even get close to the play in and that’s good for the NBA !
	And just think he will get better..... heck, we are going to get top 4 draft pick coming up... it's only going to get easier...
	Quadruple double average next season!
	Wemby hit the spot all the time
	Waiting for his quad-double
	He’s definitely getting a quad double in his career

	DPOY. The voters are going to regret getting this one wrong. Stats and eyeballs don't lie.
	🙄
	Lowell Michaels It's not a team award. It's an individual award. Did you know that Wembanyama has a much better on/off defensive rating than ANY of the other candidates for this award?
	Jason Williams it’s a “player whose defense contributed to their teams success” award. You don’t win end of year awards by losing.
	Lowell Michaels He contributed to his team's success while on the court better than any of the other guys did. So it sounds like he has your vote then.
	Jason Williams winning less games than before he got there is a contribution but not the one you are thinking of. And success is wins. Making the playoffs is success. Getting worse is the opposite.
	Lowell Michaels You really are fantastic at ignoring facts. Good job.

	At last they won
	Give the kid DPOY already.
	Next year, LeBron will be playing with Wemby along with Bronny James. Remember, LeBron is a free agent after the Play-In (GSW will beat them) and as LeBron said he will take a pay-cut to play with his son Bronny. And the San Antonio Spurs is a team with a lot of cap space whether pay cut or not, to sign LeBron and Trae Young and a bunch of PJ Tuckers. We going to make some noise next year. Lets go Spurs!
	Homer Fisk Aguiluz if you ignore actual statistics… I’d agree
	🤞 I'd love to see Bronny James play along side Weby for years to come...Pop and that system turned he whose name shall never be spoken into an all star after being known primarily as a defensive wing at San Diego State.
	This kid gonna get a quadruple double by next season.
	That's my Wemby 👏
	Wasn’t a fan of his hype, but this dude needs a solid PG and a shooter next to him.
	He's gunna be the only player with a quadruple-double in this era
	He would be a legit DPOY if their record was better but definitely Rookie of the year no cap
	Those records are ludicrous 🤣😮‍💨
	How do the spurs have less wins than the grizzlies ?
	Going to be interesting next season. Theres some interesting centers for the draft.
	Good JOB 🔥
	20th dub for the Alien rookie
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Memphis Grizzlies
	Finally beat them
	2023-2024 NBA world champion The golden states Warriors FMVP King Jonathan kuminga Mark my word!!
	Victor Wembanyama
	My crush
	Wemby always hit the spot
	ROTY and DPOY
