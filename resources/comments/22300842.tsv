	Miami Heat Vs Portland Trail Blazers
	Miami roster is deeper than where the titanic lies 🙌
	Ayton with his double-double in the first half had continued to play, Portland would have won...
	Claudio Busonero agree
	The Heat take the road one game at a time with high spirit to their 5th win in a row... keep playing healthy - Let's Go Heat!🔥🔥🔥
	NBA- with your agreement to 2k you are allowing them to, 
	I think in the eastern conference everybody sleep on the Miami heat team.
	Let's go Miami Heat 😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️💪💪💪💪
	Nice work, Jimmy Buckets!!
	...slow start. but the team composure was still there and managed to lead in the start of other half. #Heatculture
	Blazer fell apart after Ayton got hurt

	Playoffs Himmy loading.
	It started again 🔥
	Hold on, did Tyler, Niko, JJJ, Duncan play? Remember the package 🥴
	Jco Aumoithe Herro didn't and shouldn't we still should trade him. Duncan is so damn improved all around. Him and Rozier is a nice starting back court, Herro would have to get ready to come off the bench and even then.. we have so much young talent that need minutes..
	I mean it is Portland lol
	Alden Rodriguez i mean it’s an nba team lol
	Brandon Chase Mitchell still one of the worst ones especially for a team that was just in the finals last year lol a post about beating them isn’t really something new
	Alden Rodriguez a dub is a dub man lol 🤷‍♂️
	It's about that time
	Good job Jimmy Buckets
	Nice Heat🔥
	Things are heating up in Miami Heat 🔥
	Good job
	Jimmy  let`s go

	The East runs through Miami. #HeatNation
	Jimmy Butler
	Wow.. Great win🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥let's go...nice to be back Jimmy.. Without Jimmy and rozier miami line up still good.. But focus on winning
	A mí no me sorprende que Jimmy Butler tenga mucho robos en un partido recuerden que de por vida butter tiene un promedio en la nubes en el cielo de 1.6 y miami en el este pa mi en mi entender tiene un chase que tiene que aprovechar por qué el equipo que está por delante de ellos 76sixers está jugando malísimo este mes los 76sixers tuvieron 12 juegos jugao 4-8 en febrero horrible fatalmente mal y el heat a tenido 10 juegos jugados con 8-2 en febrero mejor que el rival que le queda alante entoce al Boston ganarle a los 76sixers y el heat ganarle a uno de los peores equipo del difícil enredeao comolicao oeste Portland trail blazers se empata con el horriblemente momento feo que pasa los 76sixers sin su pívot Center estelar MVP en el 2023 y 5 MVP en la franquicia de los 76sixers con Allen Iverson Wilt chamberlain Moses Malone ECT Joel embitt que están fatalmente muy mal el heat desde los playoffs del Año pasao esto para nada me sorprende ni brinco ni me vuelvo loco descontrodo y me entancao vocear por heat demostró muy buena calidad en verdad en esto playoffs y entoce pa que sorpenderse de esta vaina seria de locos el heat era el 8 el último equipo que clasificó en el play in y eliminaron al primero milwakee bucks 4-1 entoce el año pasado esa vaina

	The heat should be credited with only a half a win because the blazers are a hapless, leaderless boolshit team.
	It’s Portland not hard to beat them
