TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Good job Sixers 🏀🏀🏀
	Am I seeing that score correctly? What year is this 1994?
	both team loses to kobe's 81
	 and that during this modern weak era 140 vs 150 point a game.. 🤦‍♂️🤣
	It's like Mike Tyson boxing against some internet Donut and losing, it's embarrassing 😳 
	 I couldn’t decide which emoji to push…. Heart or laugh…. Greatest comment ever. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 anything,just not the angry one 😁✌️
	79-73? Has the 2nd half started yet?
	90s basketball 😆
	Was defense actually played or did the offense stink it up 😂
	that pace mustve been really slow.  think teams average bout 20 more shots per game than was taken in this game.  weird.
	I hope that he can do it again against the Knicks on Tuesday night.😄👏🏽👍🏽🏀❤💙
	Westchester Knicks vs Delaware Blue Coats 😩😭💀🤣
	1990s games in a nutshell
	Luka alone would go in overtime with Knicks..😀
	Oubre was a great pickup. Glad he is elevating his game this season.
	A game where both teams played defense? Amazing
	They will meet again after a day. Knicks won't play with their food next time
	Did they stop the game in the 3rd?! 
	They stopped the game at the end of the  3rd and called it a day
	the worst game ive seen the Knicks play.  It was disgusting offense...  At least 76ers have an excuse since they didnt have Maxey or Embiid...  But the Knicks straight up pathetic today.
	 the Knicks don’t have their stars either
	 they had Brunson.  They've been missing Randle and Robinson sure.   But to be fair they've been play most of the season without both of them so it's nothing they v aren't used to for the past 2 months.
	 Brunson couldn’t be 100 % and I’m a 76ers fan
	" I don't think so either after the knee thing but he played and he forced some horrible plays and shots.   Especially in the 4th quarter when it was other people closing the gap.  Hart was feeling it finally in the 4th should've shot mo… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Somebody said low scoring games are good. But it's just a brick game with 32.5% and 38.8% field goal %
	wow that was a low scoring game
	This game ended in the third quarter?
	In EuroLeague such scores are usual. But in 40 minutes.
	What a tough Defense, it's very hard to score.
	Defense wins championships. DEFENSE!
	Thought it was half time scoreboard
	big win for sixers 😍
	Oh i see  a NCAA march madness score game
	Did they just play 3 quarters??
	Just wait until Knicks get healthy... Starting front line out... We will show up when it counts
	Played the 1st half and forfeited the game🤣
	Was this game played in the late 80s?
	Spurs vs Pistons 05
	A whole ncaa game. March madness.
	Both teams decided to play defense apparently 🤣
	79-73 in halftime!! Both teams were on fire🔥🔥
	was the defense that good or the shooting was just horrible
	average score of 90's games
	It must be 2003, 73 is the kind of score the Spurs would allow when they were playing well. 😁😁
	Haven't seen this kind of score since Dirk's Dallas.
	Its only 3 quarter? 😂😂😂
	We got 2 teams putting up less than 80 points in a game in 2024 but yet people are screaming how this era is so much more skilled and how Jordan played against plumbers. Who the fuck was playing this game? Garbage men?
	Someone's Sega Genesis system jammed
	The smell of money in the air.
	After holding a team  to 74  than you get held to 73🫣🏀🏀🏀
	What in the world is this final point total
	 we finally had a real nba game in your nba lifetime??? Finally a score that isn’t depressing
	 would you go to bed, bruh
	 y
	What the hell this a g leagur game or sum
	What year is this?...
	No Europeans in both teams?
	Low scores like NCA and BAL
	K.O really playing good
	What country is this?
	Worst match this season ??
	A college score wtf
	Brick festival
	Was that the final score?? 😂 damn
	3rd quarter score
	It's sad that they don't have EMBID 😔 because the nba finals would've been between  PHILLY VS DENVER 🫡💯🏆🏀
	HS basketball ass score🤣
	Dont know if good defense or bad offense lol
	Soooo whatever happened with this mysterious driver who hit him on the bike?
	 what difference does it mean to you?   Were you the one that hit him or do you know something we don’t know?? All in someone business
	- Sir… It was ALL OVER THE NEWS AND MEDIA OUTLETS 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️. Acting like it was low key…. It was public information, Guy…
	 was is the key word , let it go unless you have info that can disprove his words, guy
	- LoL huh? Shit was a public topic which I was speaking on. Just suspect is all…not even as serious as you’re making it out to be. Hahah. It was casual curiosity.
	 but bring it up at all. They’re talking about a game n how he has been playing.  You’re talking about an incident that happened 6 or 7 months ago.
	Respectfully, I see your
	 ok
	The over under was 212
	Did putin bet on the under? 🤣
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs New York Knicks
	They going to play the second half or just call it?
	Damn wheres the defense?
	90s game, haha
	So did he actually get hight by a car or did he just make it up ?
	Defense? Is that you?
	Building Brick House?
	Clap your hands everybody for  !
	Half time;
	79-73 ? Did they play just 3 quarters ? xD
	For the whooping 😅
	Nobody showed up for the 4th period?
	Whoever picked up the below 160 point total bet gonna go crazy🤣😭
	This 2007 ?
	Euroligue?
	Kelly Oubre Jr.
	Compared to Michael Jordan, who is more powerful in terms of James' versatility on the court and his impact on the team as a whole?
	As a diehard Knicks fan playing like this is unacceptable no excuses
	Glad I didn't spend 200 on a ticket
	Thats a 90s score.
	"Imma do this once sending 5 grand to the first ""7"" People to hmu with ""TOUGH TIME"" Cus i feel some people Going Through"
	Congratulations to the 1974 sixers
	They only play 3 quarters due to rain???
	 🥱
	
	I’m a warrior’s fan but this game was rigged up because he kicked Donte in his face and there was a no call on that like really these referees don’t need no job because they don’t do right
