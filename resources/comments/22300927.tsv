TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHI	Good job Sixers 🏀🏀🏀
PHI	Am I seeing that score correctly? What year is this 1994?
	Franky Ramirez That means the defense is good on both team, you dum dum
	Ha Yura no that means they suck at shooting i literally watch that game you dumbass they percentage at shooting is only 30%
	Ha Yura if you watched the game you’d know that the shooting was what caused the score to be so low, not good defending lol
	Franky Ramirez europe basketball
	🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Franky Ramirez At the next practice, they need to work on scoring. This is the 2024 NBA, not college. Nobody plays defense. Bald headed shame!!
	Franky Ramirez I was thinking the same thing
	😂 and I still don’t believe defense was being played in this game these 2 teams are just bad as of the past month or so

	79-73? Has the 2nd half started yet?
	🤣🤣🤣
	90s basketball 😆
	Jeremy Fackrell THE BEST
	Nah. 9 for 40 from 3
	that pace mustve been really slow.  think teams average bout 20 more shots per game than was taken in this game.  weird.
	Was defense actually played or did the offense stink it up 😂
	Jake Nail i think the latter offense stink it up
	Jake Nail both teams had missing players lol
	Jake Nail both
NYK	I hope that he can do it again against the Knicks on Tuesday night.😄👏🏽👍🏽🏀❤💙
	Westchester Knicks vs Delaware Blue Coats 😩😭💀🤣
	1990s games in a nutshell
NYK	Luka alone would go in overtime with Knicks..😀
	ahahahaha fact
PHI	Oubre was a great pickup. Glad he is elevating his game this season.
NYK	They will meet again after a day. Knicks won't play with their food next time
	A game where both teams played defense? Amazing
	Marilyn J. Wiley nope not really just neither one could sink shots lol
	Did they stop the game in the 3rd?! 
	They stopped the game at the end of the  3rd and called it a day
	Somebody said low scoring games are good. But it's just a brick game with 32.5% and 38.8% field goal %
	Hilmi Firdaus there's a healthy balance....
NYK	the worst game ive seen the Knicks play.  It was disgusting offense...  At least 76ers have an excuse since they didnt have Maxey or Embiid...  But the Knicks straight up pathetic today.
NYK	Ricky Nguyen the Knicks don’t have their stars either
NYK	Eric R Branch II they had Brunson.  They've been missing Randle and Robinson sure.   But to be fair they've been play most of the season without both of them so it's nothing they v aren't used to for the past 2 months.
NYK	Ricky Nguyen Brunson couldn’t be 100 % and I’m a 76ers fan
NYK	Eric R Branch II I don't think so either after the knee thing but he played and he forced some horrible plays and shots.   Especially in the 4th quarter when it was other people closing the gap.  Hart was feeling it finally in the 4th should've shot mo… Wyświetl więcej
	🤡 watch basketball
	wow that was a low scoring game
	This game ended in the third quarter?
	In EuroLeague such scores are usual. But in 40 minutes.
	What a tough Defense, it's very hard to score.
	Thought it was half time scoreboard
NYK	Just wait until Knicks get healthy... Starting front line out... We will show up when it counts
NYK	I hope you’re right
PHI	big win for sixers 😍
	Was this game played in the late 80s?
	Defense wins championships. DEFENSE!
	Oh i see  a NCAA march madness score game
	A whole ncaa game. March madness.
	Played the 1st half and forfeited the game🤣
	Both teams decided to play defense apparently 🤣
	Dafuk happened here? Did game end after 3rd quarter lol
	Halftime score? Haha
	79-73 in halftime!! Both teams were on fire🔥🔥
	was the defense that good or the shooting was just horrible
	Spurs vs Pistons 05
	Did they just play 3 quarters??
	Ruben Garcia only two
	average score of 90's games
	Santiago Ordoñez more like 00s
	It must be 2003, 73 is the kind of score the Spurs would allow when they were playing well. 😁😁
	Scott Douglas King champs!
	😁😁
	Scott Douglas King You mean Detroit?
	Patrick Atienza well, I meant 2003 with the Spurs, but yes those Pistons back then were great too.
	Patrick Atienza the Spurs gave the Pistons their first NBA championship loss!
PHI	Sixers 31/80 39%
	Haven't seen this kind of score since Dirk's Dallas.
	Its only 3 quarter? 😂😂😂
	We got 2 teams putting up less than 80 points in a game in 2024 but yet people are screaming how this era is so much more skilled and how Jordan played against plumbers. Who the fuck was playing this game? Garbage men?
	The smell of money in the air.
	Someone's Sega Genesis system jammed
	After holding a team  to 74  than you get held to 73🫣🏀🏀🏀
	Dee we finally had a real nba game in your nba lifetime??? Finally a score that isn’t depressing
	Ricky Wright would you go to bed, bruh
	Dee Elle y
	Ricky Wright exactly
	What in the world is this final point total
	What the hell this a g leagur game or sum
	What year is this?...
	No Europeans in both teams?
	Low scores like NCA and BAL
PHI	K.O really playing good
	Most likely Boston vs Lakers in 2010 NBA FINALS 😂😂😂
	What country is this?
	Worst match this season ??
	A college score wtf
	Brick festival
	Was that the final score?? 😂 damn
	3rd quarter score
	Jessy O'Connor Beau Brackley games been played in the 1970’s
	Stephen Jack games need to be like this all the time
PHI	It's sad that they don't have EMBID 😔 because the nba finals would've been between  PHILLY VS DENVER 🫡💯🏆🏀
	HS basketball ass score🤣
	Dont know if good defense or bad offense lol
PHI	Soooo whatever happened with this mysterious driver who hit him on the bike?
	Brandon Jordan what difference does it mean to you?   Were you the one that hit him or do you know something we don’t know?? All in someone business
	🤣🤦🏽‍♂️. Acting like it was low key…. It was public information, Guy…
PHI	Brandon Jordan was is the key word , let it go unless you have info that can disprove his words, guy
	George- LoL huh? Shit was a public topic which I was speaking on. Just suspect is all…not even as serious as you’re making it out to be. Hahah. It was casual curiosity.
PHI	Brandon Jordan but bring it up at all. They’re talking about a game n how he has been playing.  You’re talking about an incident that happened 6 or 7 months ago.
	Respectfully, I see your
	Brandon Jordan ok
	The over under was 212
	Did putin bet on the under? 🤣
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs New York Knicks
	They going to play the second half or just call it?
	Damn wheres the defense?
	When did Philly get a WNBA team?
	90s game, haha
	Its like halftime.score for a Pacers or Mavs game
PHI	So did he actually get hight by a car or did he just make it up ?
	Defense? Is that you?
	Building Brick House?

	Bailey Laursen
NYK	I’m a warrior’s fan but this game was rigged up because he kicked Donte in his face and there was a no call on that like really these referees don’t need no job because they don’t do right
