	Great game
	Clippers haven't been the same since Westbrook's injury
	Brandon Fanie Bayeni The Flips are always going to flip!
	Clippers were intentionally let the hawks won this game in two reasons: 
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Younger player is best way...fresh leg..and .good condition... alot chances to make championship
	🏆🔝Biggest!!!!!!!!🔝🏆
	Hawks could hold a team under 100 pts now? Might be just a miserable shooting night for the Clippers, right?
	Jo Ker Hatden just sucks!
	good sample, atlanta dont need trae young 🤣
