	Great game
	Clippers haven't been the same since Westbrook's injury
	 The Flips are always going to flip!
	Clippers were intentionally let the hawks won this game in two reasons: 
	Younger player is best way...fresh leg..and .good condition... alot chances to make championship
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Hawks could hold a team under 100 pts now? Might be just a miserable shooting night for the Clippers, right?
	 Hatden just sucks!
	Great job dejounte
	good sample, atlanta dont need trae young 🤣
	 must be trolling

	They're on a terrible shooting!can't stop the good rhythm!what happen to the clippers D?looks like they are not prepared?
	Heats should of grab him
	Lakers should have pull the trade..
	Clippers are a embarrassment. George 1 assist

	Don't worry Clippers, the Lakers will revenge against them tomorrow
