TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHI	I'm happy for Joel Embiid.
PHI	Good job Embiid 🏀🏀🏀 welcome to the game
OKC	Funny they didn't mention in the headline that SGA and Jalen Williams didn't play tonight lol.
PHI	Not bad 12/12 ft.
	Good game referee’s
OKC	Thunder had their best players sitting. Makes since they won.
PHI	M favorite player is baack to terrorize them in play offs
OKC	🤣
OKC	😂😂😂😂
PHI	That's awesome! Joel Embiid really showed his skills in his comeback game. 🏀🔥
PHI	They would have been in a better position if he won't hurt
PHI	Can he sustain these final games and the postseason he’s still not 100%, pretty risky!
PHI	Road to ring!
PHI	Nice return, hoping he can stay healthy. If so and new pieces gel like they should around Embiid. We can make a little noise.
PHI	You better pray to at least get the 7th seed at the end of the season cuz you wont beat Boston if your the 8th but as the 7th against Milwaukee you have a chance to advance!
PHI	Just play rest of the games for me buddy and we locking up 1st in fantasy  .  Can't believe I was able to get off waivers to go with jokic and wemby.  This the fantasy dream team
PHI	Give him a Mvp he deserves it
PHI	Half man, half free throws! lol
PHI	Jo Ker maybe the league should learn how to defend him without fouling
	Il est clair que c'est un retour précipité pour garder les sixers dans la zone des playoff mais il faut y aller doucement
PHI	The NBA wasn’t about to let him lose after a surprise appearance.
	Michael Nunley c'est la NBA qui joue sur le parquet ? Pourquoi tu es stupide pour rien?
	Brice Pony Mbarga the last foul called on Chet was on Embid, plain as day, are you blind?
	Michael Nunley it was clearly a blocking foul. You may not understand the rules
	Michael Nunley If you actually watched the game, they called some BS offensive fouls against Embiid
	Michael Nunley OKC missed 4 shots in a row in the last 10 seconds of the game. And they had plenty of chances before that to win.
PHI	Return with a solid performance 💪
PHI	This year's MVP is back
PHI	Came back just in time to go home 1st round of the playoffs!🫣

	Un excelente Jugador, se que tanto el equipo como los fanáticos te extrañaban máquina 💪🏻💪🏻... ¡Bienvenido Nuevamente Joel Embiid!
OKC	OKC was doomed after having no JDub or SGA and Embiid being ruled ready to go lol
PHI	Embiid didn’t have surgery for his MCL?  Thought he will be out for the rest of the year ?🤔
	George Tai thought wrong
	🤦🏻‍♂️
