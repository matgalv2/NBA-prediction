TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I'm happy for Joel Embiid.
	Good job Embiid 🏀🏀🏀 welcome to the game
	Funny they didn't mention in the headline that SGA and Jalen Williams didn't play tonight lol.
	Not bad 12/12 ft.
	Good game referee’s
	Thunder had their best players sitting. Makes since they won.
	M favorite player is baack to terrorize them in play offs
	🤣
	😂😂😂😂
	That's awesome! Joel Embiid really showed his skills in his comeback game. 🏀🔥
	They would have been in a better position if he won't hurt
	Can he sustain these final games and the postseason he’s still not 100%, pretty risky!
	Road to ring!
	Nice return, hoping he can stay healthy. If so and new pieces gel like they should around Embiid. We can make a little noise.
	You better pray to at least get the 7th seed at the end of the season cuz you wont beat Boston if your the 8th but as the 7th against Milwaukee you have a chance to advance!
	Just play rest of the games for me buddy and we locking up 1st in fantasy  .  Can't believe I was able to get off waivers to go with jokic and wemby.  This the fantasy dream team
	Give him a Mvp he deserves it
	Half man, half free throws! lol
	Jo Ker maybe the league should learn how to defend him without fouling
	Il est clair que c'est un retour précipité pour garder les sixers dans la zone des playoff mais il faut y aller doucement
	The NBA wasn’t about to let him lose after a surprise appearance.
	Michael Nunley c'est la NBA qui joue sur le parquet ? Pourquoi tu es stupide pour rien?
	Brice Pony Mbarga the last foul called on Chet was on Embid, plain as day, are you blind?
	Michael Nunley it was clearly a blocking foul. You may not understand the rules
	Michael Nunley If you actually watched the game, they called some BS offensive fouls against Embiid
	Michael Nunley OKC missed 4 shots in a row in the last 10 seconds of the game. And they had plenty of chances before that to win.
	Return with a solid performance 💪
	This year's MVP is back
	Came back just in time to go home 1st round of the playoffs!🫣
	Nice work Joel!!
	Trust the process
	JO is back 😭 I am is best fan In all Cameroon
	Joel Embiid was solid indeed

	If my bank account didn't get hacked I would've made a good amount on this game! 💢😠 happy to have the big fella back in the mix ! We back in this thing !
	I can’t believe kelly oubre is on a 1-year deal….dudes a baller
	Un excelente Jugador, se que tanto el equipo como los fanáticos te extrañaban máquina 💪🏻💪🏻... ¡Bienvenido Nuevamente Joel Embiid!
	OKC was doomed after having no JDub or SGA and Embiid being ruled ready to go lol
	Embiid didn’t have surgery for his MCL?  Thought he will be out for the rest of the year ?🤔
	George Tai thought wrong
	🤦🏻‍♂️
	congrats 👍
	Congrats 🎉
	soliiid performance
	Well done
	Evan Grantham  not bad first game from Injury
	Bradley Watson only 24 points? Loser
	Evan Grantham not wrong
	Imbiid is back..
	Must be the Skechers👟
	Bon retour 💙
	This team will going to choke in PlayOffs aside from Boston Celtics.
	Without shai / jdub 😂😂

	Oh look. The free throw merchant is back. 🙄🤦‍♀️
	Nothing solid about the last minute flops. Refs holding it down better tbh.
	Mark G's Flops?  Eh....worst call late
	🎊
	Chet isn’t on the 76ers!
