	I'm happy for Joel Embiid.
	Good job Embiid 🏀🏀🏀 welcome to the game
	Funny they didn't mention in the headline that SGA and Jalen Williams didn't play tonight lol.
	Not bad 12/12 ft.
	Good game referee’s
	M favorite player is baack to terrorize them in play offs
	 till 2nd round 🤣
	 yeah...cuz he's known for showing up in the playoffs 😂😂😂😂
	Thunder had their best players sitting. Makes since they won.
	Road to ring!
	They would have been in a better position if he won't hurt
	That's awesome! Joel Embiid really showed his skills in his comeback game. 🏀🔥
	Can he sustain these final games and the postseason he’s still not 100%, pretty risky!
	Nice return, hoping he can stay healthy. If so and new pieces gel like they should around Embiid. We can make a little noise.
	You better pray to at least get the 7th seed at the end of the season cuz you wont beat Boston if your the 8th but as the 7th against Milwaukee you have a chance to advance!
	Just play rest of the games for me buddy and we locking up 1st in fantasy  .  Can't believe I was able to get off waivers to go with jokic and wemby.  This the fantasy dream team
	Half man, half free throws! lol
	 maybe the league should learn how to defend him without fouling
	The NBA wasn’t about to let him lose after a surprise appearance.
	Give him a Mvp he deserves it
	Il est clair que c'est un retour précipité pour garder les sixers dans la zone des playoff mais il faut y aller doucement
	Return with a solid performance 💪
	中鋒喬丹，9LMB！！！
	Trust the process
	This year's MVP is back
	Came back just in time to go home 1st round of the playoffs!🫣
