	Brian Wayne Boyett you're embarrassing yourself. You're celebrating regular season stands now? Setting the bar low. What has Boston won in the last decade?
	Brian Wayne Boyett 11/22 119-116 - Celtics, 1/11 - 135-102 - Bucks. Where’s the blowout you’re referring to?
	Brian Wayne Boyett
	Brian Wayne Boyett that's rich since the celtics lost to Charlotte lol. Bucks are getting better and celtics may be good in the regular season but brown and Tatum choke harder then a $2 whore in the post season lol. Atleast the bucks won a chip recently
