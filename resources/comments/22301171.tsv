	Best center in the league when healthy. 💯
	 if you have to say when healthy he ain’t the best 🤣
	 most talented center ever
	 player*
	 “when healthy” but we don’t live in imaginary world 🤣
	
	 2nd best
	That's how an MVP impacts his whole team
	 still not on Jokics level 😖
	 Jokic just lost to a lottery team. Just saying lol
	 buddy if you can’t admit he’s better than jokic it’s out of pure hate for embiids play style. The last 2 times embiid and jokic matched up embiid has averaged 40 and bout 10 boards
	3 time mvp with a ring still 😖
	 and what happens when they face to face?
	 won’t even argue on someone who can’t make it past the 2nd round lol
	 and who would you rather have in a 7 game series?
	 jokic lose tonight against wemby while embiid drop 70 on wemby head lol
	 💍
	 anytime someone brings up actual stats from jokic vs embiid y’all run right to the playoffs 💀💀 Embiid vs jokic= embiid bullying denver and jokic all game. What’s embiid 6-2 against jokic?
	 but Embiid can’t play Jokic in Denver I don’t even want to hear it
	Ask any NBA expert who is better 🤦🏽‍♂️
	You Sixers fans are delusional
	 Bro Jokic just let the #1 seed go to one of the worst teams in the NBA. That will cost him big time trust me
	 and they’ll say embiid
	 jokic can't play D to save his life
	 lols, look at jokic teammates
	Jeffrey Panopio just like embiid can’t play D in the most important game of the series, when he got abused by tatum in the pick and roll and scored 51pts against his “elite” defense, to secure embiid’s yearly second round exits  🤣
	 But still in the play in
	 Wow you really are a basketball genius! 😳😳😳
	The boss is back 💥🔥
	Get in there sunday big guy. Secure that 6th spot and also my fantasy basketball championship while were at it
	playoff choke same thing every year 😂😂😂
	 Hahahaha, he's too.
	 define “bum”
	 choke choke choke enough said
	 definitely not a fan he’s a bum definitely 😂😂😂
	 15pts in the most important game, only 2pts in the second half, abused in pnr by tatum who scored 51pts, to secure embiid’s 5th second round exit. choker 🤣
	True MVP
	He’s the one and only MVP💪🔵⚪️
	Orlando Magic Vs Philadelphia 76ers
	Blessing in disguise for his injury. Much needed rest
	Como esse cara eleva o nível do six, é incrível.
	MVP MVP Embiid ❤️❤️❤️
	We coming for that 5th seed!
	*il monte en puissance
	❤️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
	Embiid led from the front
	MVP
	That was a great game.
	Awesome
	This man is the MVP of the season. Sadly his games played won't allow it.
	Can’t play that song tonight Magic.
	Joel Embiid
	Congratulations
	It’s about time for Orlando to sign Summer League legend Kai Sotto to secure a deep run in the playoffs! 😤 <a class=
	 smokey
	That's a great picture of you and God bless you!!! 😇🙏
	It's like he never left
	Philly looks pretty dangerous Embiid playing well
	6TH SEED!!!!!
	The way i teach him.
	Wemby needs to learn
	Magics choking.. but they didnt have an easy last 3 game schedual bucks, 76ers, bucks.
	Diamond you sexy
	He's the best Center
	 why he do the Jimmy butler braids
	🥰🥰
	As a hawks fan, I hope Philly stays in that 6th spot 🤞
	B.J.
