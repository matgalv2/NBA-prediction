TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHI	Best center in the league when healthy. 💯
ORL	🤣
PHI	Jeffrey Panopio most talented center ever
PHI	Jeffrey Panopio player*
ORL	🤣
	Jeffrey Panopio
	Jeffrey Panopio 2nd best
PHI	That's how an MVP impacts his whole team
	😖
	Chris Mascarenas Jokic just lost to a lottery team. Just saying lol
PHI	Chris Mascarenas buddy if you can’t admit he’s better than jokic it’s out of pure hate for embiids play style. The last 2 times embiid and jokic matched up embiid has averaged 40 and bout 10 boards
	3 time mvp with a ring still 😖
	Chris Mascarenas and what happens when they face to face?
	Joe Elliott won’t even argue on someone who can’t make it past the 2nd round lol
	Basketball Genius and who would you rather have in a 7 game series?
	Chris Mascarenas jokic lose tonight against wemby while embiid drop 70 on wemby head lol
	💍
PHI	💀💀 Embiid vs jokic= embiid bullying denver and jokic all game. What’s embiid 6-2 against jokic?
PHI	Joe Elliott but Embiid can’t play Jokic in Denver I don’t even want to hear it
	Ask any NBA expert who is better 🤦🏽‍♂️
PHI	You Sixers fans are delusional
	Chris Mascarenas Bro Jokic just let the #1 seed go to one of the worst teams in the NBA. That will cost him big time trust me
	Chris Mascarenas and they’ll say embiid
	Chris Mascarenas jokic can't play D to save his life
	Chris Mascarenas lols, look at jokic teammates
PHI	Jeffrey Panopio just like embiid can’t play D in the most important game of the series, when he got abused by tatum in the pick and roll and scored 51pts against his “elite” defense, to secure embiid’s yearly second round exits  🤣
	Basketball Genius But still in the play in
	😳😳😳
PHI	The boss is back 💥🔥
	Get in there sunday big guy. Secure that 6th spot and also my fantasy basketball championship while were at it
PHI	playoff choke same thing every year 😂😂😂
	Jordan Escobar Hahahaha, he's too.
	Jordan Escobar define “bum”
	Ryan Fox choke choke choke enough said
	😂😂😂
	Jordan Escobar imagine a guy who looks like a soft bag of rice calling a professional athlete a bum. Real winner mentality you have there.
	Jordan Escobar man stop the boy puts up monster numbers when healthy
	🤣
	True MVP
	Blessing in disguise for his injury. Much needed rest
	Como esse cara eleva o nível do six, é incrível.
PHI	He’s the one and only MVP💪🔵⚪️
PHI	MVP MVP Embiid ❤️❤️❤️
