NYK	He’s a little man, Beast For New York knickerbockers yours truly 💪🏾🏀😎🙏🏿
NYK	Let's go new york Knicks and keep up with the good work. Jb
NYK	Good win but he needs to pass the rock some more
NYK	Jovan Patterson Dudes say this but don’t realize he’s had 10+ assists just a few games (multiple games) ago…Like the other dude said since we don’t have all our players back Brunson has to score AND facilitate while teams are throwing multiple looks at him
NYK	And he must continue that average 8 to many people on the team
NYK	Jovan Patterson only guy back is og Randle down and others he had to make up for 25+ points missing
NYK	Jah Jenkins you see our role players can’t tell me that nobody could hit threes in corner he took a lot of 1v1 shots which could lead to better transition shots you have OG da big ragou precious Josh hart and so on his shot selection is gonna be needed more in playoff time
NYK	Jah Jenkins I forgot brogdan
NYK	45 points is great
NYK	We on our way to being a solid winning team again
NYK	Rahn Garland we are secure finishing 4th and we have been winning but once whole team is back the Knicks will be a problem
	How many 3-pointers can Curry make in his career?
NYK	Still hard to believe he this good, he really Him
NYK	Mavs should’ve kept Brunson…
NYK	calm down jalen
NYK	🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

	Who cares? Anyone can score 45 now days. The refs get more than that regularly.
	David Martin I care
	Tăng Gia Di why? 99% of NBA players cheat on their wives and girlfriends. They’re egomaniacs who regularly beat women up, a lot of them can’t read and react violently when challenged. You trying to get beat and cheated on?
	David Martin Ordinary people are the same way lol, And in today's society, people only care about how much money you make, Most people live for money and sex, Let's relax
	Tăng Gia Di naw let’s call it what it is. A big child who has never had to grow up because life handed him a genetic lottery ticket. I’ll bet he can’t read.
