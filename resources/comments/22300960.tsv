	He’s a little man, Beast For New York knickerbockers yours truly 💪🏾🏀😎🙏🏿
	Let's go new york Knicks and keep up with the good work. Jb
	Good win but he needs to pass the rock some more
	 Dudes say this but don’t realize he’s had 10+ assists just a few games (multiple games) ago…Like the other dude said since we don’t have all our players back Brunson has to score AND facilitate while teams are throwing multiple looks at him
	And he must continue that average 8 to many people on the team
	 only guy back is og Randle down and others he had to make up for 25+ points missing
	" you see our role players can’t tell me that nobody could hit threes in corner he took a lot of 1v1 shots which could lead to better transition shots you have OG da big ragou precious Josh hart and so on his shot selection is gonna be needed… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 I forgot brogdan
	We on our way to being a solid winning team again
	 we are secure finishing 4th and we have been winning but once whole team is back the Knicks will be a problem
	Still hard to believe he this good, he really Him
	How many 3-pointers can Curry make in his career?
	45 points is great
	Mavs should’ve kept Brunson…
	 he can't do his games under the shadow of luka...
	 nah...as a Knicks fan...I'm glad he's ours. He's a stud and he is the clear leader of our team
	🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
	🧡💙
	calm down jalen
	♥️♥️♥️❤️
	We knicks nation will take it all the way...We on our way to being a solid winning team again
	Mr.one man show😎
	always thought brunson gets way too many calls.  initiates all the contact , falls down. goes to the line. 
	Wow we love you Brunson!
	Another great Knicks perfomance putting the opposite team scores a little
	"Jalen ""Charles"" Brunson"
	Good luck!
	I agree with you
	Cheer up!

	Who cares? Anyone can score 45 now days. The refs get more than that regularly.
	 I care
	 why? 99% of NBA players cheat on their wives and girlfriends. They’re egomaniacs who regularly beat women up, a lot of them can’t read and react violently when challenged. You trying to get beat and cheated on?
	 Ordinary people are the same way lol, And in today's society, people only care about how much money you make, Most people live for money and sex, Let's relax
	 naw let’s call it what it is. A big child who has never had to grow up because life handed him a genetic lottery ticket. I’ll bet he can’t read.
