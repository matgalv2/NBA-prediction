	DeMar DeRozan pitched in for the Bulls
	Good job DeRozan
	Great win stay in this mode for the last 10 games hold it down stay locked in
	The way they played is the way they should play every night good win bulls.
	Rick Carlisle and his rotation are to blame here, Halliburton is rarely playing any 4th Quarters..
	Here goes another 4 game winning streak before 500 then start losing again lol
	 way to be negative about it 😒
	 every time lol
	When are we going to be an above .500 team and a decent playoff team
	💪💪💪
	DeMar DeRozan dominated this game
	DeMar DeRozan 👌🏿🔥
	Back to his scoring ways hope next season he will deliver more than he is known for his scoring and more   .
	Good win but man it's like they choose which games to show up in. Example. Vooch didn't do sh** against Washington but puts up 22/12?? You kidding me?
	Always within 3 games of .500. Smh
	Pacers under 100 ! Congrats Bulls 👏
