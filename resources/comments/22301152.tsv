TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Many compare him with the MJ but he has a lot of work to do in a mountain to achieve that mile stone. The way he plays, might be similar to MJ but mostly you all are judging him because he is a lil bit similar by face to MJ. Otherwise he has nothing yet in comparison to MJ or anyone in the NBA right now.
	Pinoy memes he’s 22 how about we just let him be him. What a weird take
	Pinoy memes Mike was just pure mean,That's how you gotta be to get where Mike was,Mike didn't hold back,Ant slack in too many games,15,17,20 Points too much,Mike would die to win,I don't see that part in Ant
	Pinoy memes get off his nuts he’s never once said he wanted to be mj
	Moneyapolis Winnesota they are a Lakers and Golden State fan. Minnesota has had maybe a hand full of nationally televised games so this fool hasn't really even seen his games and are mad cuz LA and GS are in the basement. Lol
	Pinoy memes you don't even fking watch him so go somewhere. But, even though you don't watch him, he sure seems to live in your head!
	Once Karl Anthony towns comes back. They are the complete team around NBA
	I’m sure both Purdue and UConn will sweep the Wizards in a 7-game series 😤😩😭💀🤣
	When you consider his caliber of defense, ANT is easily a top 10 overall player in the NBA. At 22. Insane
	We can’t finish the season worse than    second otherwise we get the Suns in the first round and that’s bad.
	I think Timberwolves with Edwards, Rudy and Towns are NOWgood enought to Stop the Nuggets in the playoffs!!
	Tawanda Blessing Zizhou in a 7 game series the wolves aint beating denver 4 times
	The ANTH-Man Edwards
	Be like Mike ...
	Go timberwolve

	Por eso yo digo que este muchacho lo tengo como mejor quintecto pa ete año en NBA por su buena defensa y ofesiva eh completo y tuvo a 10 puntos de empatar la marca de pasar lo 62 puntos que metió Karl Anthony towns este año y Karl towns se convirtió en el máximo anotador de Timverwoles está temporada en un juego lo hizo 2018 la primera ve y lo hizo 2022 penúltima ve Karl Anthony towns el de raza dominicana
	Wilt Chamberlain has scored the most points in a game in the history of the NBA, with 100 points against the Knicks on March 2, 1962. From 1962 till now, no player has been able to equal nor surpass the record. That's not good. 
	Anthony Edwards should join LA Lakers next season. That's where players like him belongs.
	Lawrence Rowland naw he belongs in Minnesota us fans have been dying for a player of his magnitude!
	Lawrence Rowland he wouldn't. Ant like to win on his own merits and not the refs help. He is a true athlete and not just a feigning one like LA players.
	Kimberly Sue
	Lawrence Rowland, your comment appears to exhibit an excessive level of admiration for a team that seems to be characterized by a sense of entitlement and uncritical support.
	Kimberly Sue keep Edwards here in Minnesota
	💯
	What is this? We doing pinky promises again?
	What a WIZARD Anthony Edwards is, congrats to the entire team for the win 🏀🐺
