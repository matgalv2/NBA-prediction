	I’m sure both Purdue and UConn will sweep the Wizards in a 7-game series 😤😩😭💀🤣
	Once Karl Anthony towns comes back. They are the complete team around NBA
	Many compare him with the MJ but he has a lot of work to do in a mountain to achieve that mile stone. The way he plays, might be similar to MJ but mostly you all are judging him because he is a lil bit similar by face to MJ. Otherwise he has nothing yet in comparison to MJ or anyone in the NBA right now.
	 he’s 22 how about we just let him be him. What a weird take
	 Mike was just pure mean,That's how you gotta be to get where Mike was,Mike didn't hold back,Ant slack in too many games,15,17,20 Points too much,Mike would die to win,I don't see that part in Ant
	 get off his nuts he’s never once said he wanted to be mj
	 they are a Lakers and Golden State fan. Minnesota has had maybe a hand full of nationally televised games so this fool hasn't really even seen his games and are mad cuz LA and GS are in the basement. Lol
	 you don't even fking watch him so go somewhere. But, even though you don't watch him, he sure seems to live in your head!
	When you consider his caliber of defense, ANT is easily a top 10 overall player in the NBA. At 22. Insane
	We can’t finish the season worse than    second otherwise we get the Suns in the first round and that’s bad.
	I think Timberwolves with Edwards, Rudy and Towns are NOWgood enought to Stop the Nuggets in the playoffs!!
	 in a 7 game series the wolves aint beating denver 4 times
	Be like Mike ...
	The ANTH-Man Edwards
	Wow!
	Go timberwolve
	MVP 👑
	Wow galing

	Anthony Edwards should join LA Lakers next season. That's where players like him belongs.
	"Por eso yo digo que este muchacho lo tengo como mejor quintecto pa ete año en NBA por su buena defensa y ofesiva eh completo y tuvo a 10 puntos de empatar la marca de pasar lo 62 puntos que metió Karl Anthony towns este año y Karl towns se convirtió en… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	What is this? We doing pinky promises again?
	Wilt Chamberlain has scored the most points in a game in the history of the NBA, with 100 points against the Knicks on March 2, 1962. From 1962 till now, no player has been able to equal nor surpass the record. That's not good. 
	Still cant get on national tv
