MIL	Ian Austria Kaya nayan 2021 champion Milwaukee bucks pj tucker jrue holiday donte divincenzo Jeff tegue
MIL	"How come we never see ""4 blk, 3blk, 5blk"" in this guys stat line anymore? Its like he gave up on defense."
CHI	Where’s Funk?
MIL	The 🐐 Goat 🤝
MIL	Giannis receives more free throws then the entire bulls team and 1/2 of his own team’s total. Guarantee you some of those should have been offensive charges.
	David Cleaver lloran las rosas...
CHI	David Cleaver you didn’t watch the game clearly. Bulls were hacking all night. Vuc got ejected for a flagrant 2 hard foul. It was getting chippy. Don’t want him to shoot free throws. Strip the ball instead of hacking him.
MIL	Zach Semling That’s the problem, you can’t because anything approaching defence on him has whistle blown against it.
	David Cleaver okay clown. The best liars believe themselves. Keep it up
MIL	Zach Semling Good one. How does Giannis’ asshole taste?
MIL	David Cleaver lmao still salty?
	Zach Semling I guess, must have been right after a game before he hit the showers then.
	David Cleaver I guarantee you that you are butthurt, teach the kid you have in your hands to do a better job in his life aknowledge greatness than yourself.
MIL	Panos Mantalias nah not butthurt at all. I’m just sick of watching ugly basketball and having it lauded as some kind of achievement. Giannis is one of the worst culprits of this. Notice how you didn’t have anything to reply to the comment I made and instead went after me and my boy. Maybe you should take your own advice.
MIL	David Cleaver His whole game is charges.
	Refs were awful in this game
	bucks 🤝 refs
	Mia Martinez lol
	🔥🔥🔥
MIL	Mia Martinez Giannis  as more free throws ,not from been favoured by the refs but because most defenders prefer to foul him then to give him a clear basket now ,the narrative as changed because his making the free throws
MIL	yup, giannis gets a lot of foul calls, that’s nothing new. i’m just saying the refs weren’t calling nearly as many fouls for the bulls as they were for the bucks 🤷‍♀️ it is what it is
MIL	Mia Martinez lol that’s a lie did you watch the second quarter. They called like 10 or more fouls on the bucks in one quarter
MIL	that was the least they could do lol. doesn’t take away the fact that the bucks still had double the amount of free throws than the bulls. like i said though, it is what it is
CHI	Mia Martinez the Bulls committed THREE more fouls than the Bucks LMAO
	But that doesn't change the fact that Embiid is a African king 👑🏀
MIL	Malebo Modise king of choke in 2nd round
MIL	Malebo Modise king of always injured

MIL	Another Labron😒
MIL	Wow would you look at the free throw differential. Unreal!

MIL	Jimbo Wally tell em to keep their hands to themselves
MIL	Jimbo Wally lol, can they guard him with a soft defense tho?
MIL	Can’t even look at Giannis without a foul.
MIL	Jimbo Wally try not hacking him every other play like Miami and Boston
