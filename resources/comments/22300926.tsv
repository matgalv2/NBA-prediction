	Embarrassing loss for the Heat! Smh
	Kuzma drills the three! What an amazing shot and an even more amazing celly!!
	When was the last time this good for nothing wizards won against an eastern conference champion 🏆
	This is Heat culture 💀
	Must be exciting being a wizard
	At this point it’s like, “don’t be that team!”
	Throwing up the 👌🏻 when they’ve won 11 games all year 💀
	Rigged everyone had money on the heat to win this
	Huge win from the Wizards to cut the difference to 43.2 games.
	Miami is OVERRATED
	Always plays down to competition. Good thing thing the playoffs have higher comp
	The Heat man, that’s a funny team🤣🤣🤣
	Something wrong with the Miami team
	🤣 that's the something wrong 🤣
	April Jane Panes Alfar that was awful
	Am I the only person that looks at these highlights and hopes Poole is leading the team?
	‼️
	Linda Brennan I know but I still hope he turns it around. He legit has the skill set to get it done. He just makes very bad decisions.
	Kuzma is on 🔥
	dude almost blew the game.
	Of course it’s on my team too😡
	Pullin' a classic Jim Paredes celebration
	need to sell poole asap
	They are tanking no to be the the last team in standing 😂😂😂
	Heat is not going to repeat their Cinderella story this season!
	Nice one kuz..congrats May baby pogi...❤️❤️💪🙏😘
	That's embarrassing to lose at home to one of the 2 worst teams in the league lol
	Washington Wizards Vs Miami Heat
	Now tell me which is better?  Win a closed game or lose a closed game vs Wizards? Jst asking.....
	Dude has a chance to leave but he stayed instead. What did DC offered to this man? His own team?
	The mighty heat lost from the last team in the NBA?
	Wizards are a broken team
	You won 11 games of 53 why celebrate just do your job 
	I'm sorry y'all i almost forgot Washington had a team.
	Butler's hairstyle 😅

	Playing with no pressure at all,that's it!🙄🤣😲👀
