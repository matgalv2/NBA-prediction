	Best team in the West
	 thanks to the refs and the love story the NBA wrote to the OKC Thunder! What a joke!
	 aren't you done with excuses?
	 always a excuse fr
	Jay Snyder Shia is a queen and no one can touch her without a foul happening. Plus you live in Utah. I’m really sorry to hear that.
	 I'm stunned!
	 why does that matter?
	 juiced up?
	 excuse is like aashole. Everyone has them, so gfys.
	 only bad thing bout Utah is the democrats 😂
	 how am I not shocked you said that? Haha
	 and coming from a man named Jimbo. What a loser. Hahahaha
	 by what?
	 ok long duc dong
	 lol
	 says casual guy that doesn’t watch the games.
	 um I watch all the games. The Timberwolves get screwed on calls all season long it’s nothing new. Calm down Gary.
	 you aren’t watching the Thunder if you think they don’t get screwed all the time. Tony Brothers did his best tonight to keep it close. J-Dub and Lu get phantom whistles all the time when they don’t ever come close to touching anyone. I hope we get to play your wolves again.
	 I haven’t seen much of the thunder play only when they play the wolves. I would just like the refs to call even games! I think OKC and the Wolves playing against each other again would be fun to watch for sure! It has been all season. It’s a great battle of two really good teams!
	 for a day they will be on top max…just the same as all season long.
	 hope the will finish the season at No. 1 spot
	 who’s the will?
	Best team in your ass🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Will be interesting to see how they handle the Playoffs
	 will but looks like the rebuild has payed off regardless of playoffs or not.
	 1st round exit. 7th and 8th seed is likely Dallas and Lakers. OKC aint beating either of those.
	 Sadly, agree.
	MVP!
	Heat Culture???
	Best team in the west 😍
	Solid win for the Thunder! Cant wait to see them become legit contenders when they draft Deuce Tatum first overall in the 2050 NBA DRAFT! 😤
	 again??? 🤡🤡🤡

	Lol they told him to pass more before the season. I’m glad he didn’t

	Sarap talaga mag all-in sa mga kalaban ng heat hehe 
	 see you nalang sa playoffs
	Shai or Ja ???? Who ya taking or think better So far ?
	Lmao Notice how they dont post the MN VS CLE lmao. Because they know all the hate they will get. By far the worse officiating game ive seen in years, and there has been plenty of bad officiating games. Game finished before some posted within 2 hours yet nothing yet.
	What do you think about the western conference race for 1st?
	Awesome W I N tonight!!
	Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
	Miami Heat Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
	Shai gilgeous Alexander para mí sacará una cantidad interesante de puntos para el jugador mas valioso ese muchacho está haciendo un muy buen trabajo y su equipo está en pelea pero no creo que le quite ese MVP a Nikola jokic no lo de jokic eh día a día los triple doble y Shai gilgeous Alexander tiene como tiene dos días consecutivos con la misma cantidad de 37 puntos pero para mí el a jokic no le gana el MVP lo de jokic eh impresionante eta temporada
	Let's go OKC !!!
