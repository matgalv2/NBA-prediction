	The grizzlies  had no clue how to close out this game before or after it went into overtime.  All they did was put up 3’s when they could have run the clock down and then take a two.  That  was enough to win the game in their last possession of the forth and possibly draw a foul.  A two would have forced SAC to take the 3.  Same thing in OT.  They made the first two points and SAC missed the three, so they could have put up another two but no...they just put up threes and missed them all.  Live by the three...Die by the three!  Disgusting coaching!
	Just give him the 6th MOY already!!!!!! Monk Dunks for days!
	Awesome Malik💟💟💟💟

	I’m a greater believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.
