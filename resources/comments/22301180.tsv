TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Spurs vs Boston
	Bryan Jésie
DEN	Nuggets had this problem last year, too: where they lose to sub .500 teams, despite being a good team. I can't figure out where that reoccurring problem comes from in the team's philosophy. Playing down to competition... Idk. Either way, shouldn't make a habit of blowing sizeable leads this late in the season. It reminds me too much of the years when we weren't fully complete, or well enough disciplined to be a real championship pedigree. Hopefully that loss jostles them awake before it's too costly of a mistake.
SAS	If he has a healthy 15 to 16 years, he may very well be the only one to dethrone King James scoring title
	If healty, generational player who will hopefully make NBA teams draft bigs again and we ho back to pretty basketball not a 3pt contest
	Sandro must be in the starting lineup
	Gian Maria Sintoni he was
	Courtney Runnels just because other players were injured.
SAS	They were down 23! GSG 🔥
SAS	I think the Spurs just messed up Jokic's chances... SGA gonna win now!
	Put a team around him next year and they will be a great unit
SAS	* overcome a 23 point deficit
	Ya know, I didn't think this kid would hold up for a full 82 game season. I was wrong and he is balling out for a rookie. With the right pieces the spurs will be a scary match-up.
SAS	Everyone should be playing like this kid!
	He scored 17 points in 3 minutes in the 3rd quarter!
	Next season: Spurs vs Boston 2025 NBA finals, spurs in 6
DEN	Nuggets ducking that smoke with LeBron, they ain’t built to beat a healthy playoff king
SAS	Spurs are gonna be an issue next season
	Nuggets doesn't want to be the 1st seed, they are evading Suns or Lakers, lol!
SAS	As a wolves fan, thanks Wemby!
SAS	Put a team around this man.
	The Alien rookie getting a dub against the Defending Champion in his last few games of the season
	1 hit wonder Denver nuggets better tighten up
DEN	Whatever happens, the Nuggets is playoffs bound, no reason to be serious, they just played the game, if they win, they win and if they lose they don't care!😂
SAS	Spurs are playoff bound!
SAS	THE SPURS WERE ACTUALLY DOWN 23
SAS	How do you come up big when you're eliminated from playoffs long ago?
SAS	Congratulations to Wembanyama and Spurs team on the victory!
SAS	Bro has the physique to be the next final boss of the NBA.
SAS	Jay Che he's already next level.
	Pierre Dubois mdrrrrrr t’es bon !
SAS	wow spurs has only 21 lose and 60 wins..best record in the west in this season..
	But will they make it to the playoffs
SAS	I like the Wemby - Jokic match up, they always go at each other 👍
SAS	Second time victor has outplayed Jokic in a week
DEN	Dario Jermaine Edwards jokic dropped 42 on him last week.
DEN	Lowell Michaels 1 on 1 victor blocked two of his shots straight watch the game
	Dario Jermaine Edwards and guarded none of the others
SAS	Dario Jermaine Edwards Jokic jst went easy on him
	😭
DEN	Dario Jermaine Edwards yeah  Jokic MVP
SAS	Only they played like this for him in the beginning of the season
SAS	Wemba Rookie man ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
SAS	This rookie a killer
	Denver Nuggets Vs San Antonio Spurs
DEN	Game is given
SAS	Outplaying the MVP and winning despite being without 3 of their best players? The future is bright in San Antonio.
SAS	Wemby a dpoy, roy and all NBA defensive team for sure😊
DEN	Nuggets are too small of a team compared to San Antonio Spurs ( Popovich ) Wemby cooking Jokic i did predict that. but in his first year now for real Nuggets are cooked. 1st round exit to Los Angeles Lakers or Golden State Warriors loading 😂😂
SAS	Wemby is going to be such a huge problem.
SAS	Nice work wemby
SAS	Spurs fans would rather have greg popovich as the head coach and sit at the bottom of the nba west. Then hire anyone else. That's a fact
SAS	Go San Antonio Spurs Go !  Wemby rookie/defensive player of the Year. DevinVassell Jeremy Sochan Tre Jones NBA Keldon Johnson NBA TV
SAS	That body of wemby starting to bulk up, Imagine if this guy got a body like giannis👀
SAS	They were down by 23 at one point though?
SAS	If he was on OKC then he would be in MVP talks!
	Chris Brown doubtful cause they would be worse.
SAS	Look at his numbers stick him on a winning team! Not saying he win but he would be in talks and get some votes!
SAS	Chris Brown I would rather have the guy who puts up nearly the same defensive numbers but shoots 10-15% better.
DEN	Rough loss for Nuggets, but I still believe no one can beat them in a 7 game series. I don’t know the NBA equivalent of “Any given Sunday,” but danged if that isn’t what makes it exciting.
	It was a 23 point deficit
SAS	Wemby 4 ROY🏆
SAS	The real process!
SAS	He's getting the rhythm
SAS	Awesome 😍😍😍
SAS	Man…..Wembys day!
	Come on Wolves!
SAS	Wemby should join lakers next season
SAS	He is the future
DEN	Nuggets don't need to win 😅
SAS	This guy is to be scary
SAS	21-60 is crazy the way they've been hyping up wemby 🤣
SAS	Cory Craver they still hyping after that game when he went 12/37
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Haha hamburgero inyu wem 😂
	Now that the season is wrapping up, Pop and the front office must have figured out what they needed to complement his game. It might be a slow process but I think it's gonna be worthy as make some significant changes to their roster this coming off season.
SAS	wemba rockie man😍😍😍
	Yes
DEN	What an upset! Glad teams are trying late in the season! 🤣
DEN	Nuggets are a 1st Round Exit
SAS	To all the haters who said the Spurs are tanking this season...you look dumb!
SAS	Yeah. But that 60 loses don't look good on the giant resume
SAS	#spurs beat #denvernuggetts
	Johan Julian
	Cyril Doc
