	Spurs vs Boston
	 How is that gonna magically happen 🤭
	
	Wemby will be very busy during NBA postseason...selling lemonade in his parents front yard
	 that would require the spurs to make the playoffs.. 🤔
	 in 2026
	Wemby ballin rn but I still got him 2nd on the Rookie of the Year rankings behind 6-time and soon to be 7-time Rookie of the Year, Ben 10 Simmons! 😤😤😤
	Nuggets had this problem last year, too: where they lose to sub .500 teams, despite being a good team. I can't figure out where that reoccurring problem comes from in the team's philosophy. Playing down to competition... Idk. Either way, shouldn't make a habit of blowing sizeable leads this late in the season. It reminds me too much of the years when we weren't fully complete, or well enough disciplined to be a real championship pedigree. Hopefully that loss jostles them awake before it's too costly of a mistake.
	If he has a healthy 15 to 16 years, he may very well be the only one to dethrone King James scoring title
	 I completely agree!
	Ry King if he played 70 games for the next 15 years he would need to average 38ppg to get to 40k points (Lebron is at 40.5k and counting)
	 Luka
	 I don’t think he’s touching anywhere near the scoring title but he has the making to be the best defensive player ever
	"Ry King I agree he has potential to be the best but no one’s breaking Lebrons scoring record for a long time if ever..it takes a lot of longevity that we never saw before. Wemby will have a much shorter career I think but will accomplish a lot quick ca… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 he would have to score over 35 points a game, play the majority of the season each year, and do that for close to 20 years, I believe. Kinda insane the career you'd have to have to get to 40k points.
	Sandro must be in the starting lineup
	 he was
	 yes
	If healty, generational player who will hopefully make NBA teams draft bigs again and we ho back to pretty basketball not a 3pt contest
	They were down 23! GSG 🔥
	I think the Spurs just messed up Jokic's chances... SGA gonna win now!
	* overcome a 23 point deficit
	Put a team around him next year and they will be a great unit
	He scored 17 points in 3 minutes in the 3rd quarter!
	Ya know, I didn't think this kid would hold up for a full 82 game season. I was wrong and he is balling out for a rookie. With the right pieces the spurs will be a scary match-up.
	Nuggets ducking that smoke with LeBron, they ain’t built to beat a healthy playoff king
	Spurs are gonna be an issue next season
	Nuggets doesn't want to be the 1st seed, they are evading Suns or Lakers, lol!
	Next season: Spurs vs Boston 2025 NBA finals, spurs in 6
	As a wolves fan, thanks Wemby!
	Put a team around this man.
	Spurs are playoff bound!
	1 hit wonder Denver nuggets better tighten up
	Whatever happens, the Nuggets is playoffs bound, no reason to be serious, they just played the game, if they win, they win and if they lose they don't care!😂
	The Alien rookie getting a dub against the Defending Champion in his last few games of the season
	Bro has the physique to be the next final boss of the NBA. 
	THE SPURS WERE ACTUALLY DOWN 23
	How do you come up big when you're eliminated from playoffs long ago?
	But will they make it to the playoffs
	wow spurs has only 21 lose and 60 wins..best record in the west in this season..
	Congratulations to Wembanyama and Spurs team on the victory!
	I like the Wemby - Jokic match up, they always go at each other 👍
	Second time victor has outplayed Jokic in a week
	 Jokic jst went easy on him
	 jokic dropped 42 on him last week.
	This rookie a killer
	Only they played like this for him in the beginning of the season
	Wemba Rookie man ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
	Denver Nuggets Vs San Antonio Spurs
	Game is given
	Outplaying the MVP and winning despite being without 3 of their best players? The future is bright in San Antonio.
	Wemby a dpoy, roy and all NBA defensive team for sure😊
	Nuggets are too small of a team compared to  ( Popovich ) Wemby cooking Jokic i did predict that. but in his first year now for real Nuggets are cooked. 1st round exit to  or  loading 😂😂
	Wemby is going to be such a huge problem.
	Spurs fans would rather have greg popovich as the head coach and sit at the bottom of the nba west. Then hire anyone else. That's a fact
	Go  Go !   rookie/defensive player of the Year.  Jeremy Sochan    
	That body of wemby starting to bulk up, Imagine if this guy got a body like giannis👀
	Parang Normal lng na Matalo Ang DENVER Ng NASA Lower Bracket. 
	They were down by 23 at one point though?
	parang giannis build na si wemby
	Rough loss for Nuggets, but I still believe no one can beat them in a 7 game series. I don’t know the NBA equivalent of “Any given Sunday,” but danged if that isn’t what makes it exciting.
	If he was on OKC then he would be in MVP talks!
	It was a 23 point deficit
	 was eaten alive by  hahaha
	Wemby 4 ROY🏆
	Nice work wemby
	Halatang nagpatalo Denver Nuggets, ayaw nila mag number 1 spot, umiiwas makatapat ang lakers. 
	Everyone should be playing like this kid!
	The real process!
	He's getting the rhythm
	Awesome 😍😍😍
	Marama gyd ning nuggets
	Man…..Wembys day!
	Come on Wolves!
	Wemby should join lakers next season
	He is the future
	Nuggets don't need to win 😅
	Sandro ❤️🔥
	J'y crois pas 😲😲😲
	Énorme
	This guy is to be scary
	21-60 is crazy the way they've been hyping up wemby 🤣
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Haha hamburgero inyu wem 😂
	Denver , idemo ima jos da se igra  !!!!!
	Now that the season is wrapping up, Pop and the front office must have figured out what they needed to complement his game. It might be a slow process but I think it's gonna be worthy as make some significant changes to their roster this coming off season.
	wemba rockie man😍😍😍
	Yes
	Lakas
	  the future hahaha
	What an upset! Glad teams are trying late in the season! 🤣
	Nuggets are a 1st Round Exit
	To all the haters who said the Spurs are tanking this season...you look dumb!
	Yeah. But that 60 loses don't look good on the giant resume
	 beat 
	Pas de block ? 😳
	Konting dagdag pa na makakatulong nya makakabawi yan next confie
	
	
	 🤯
	😱
	This is his ROOKIE YEAR! What doubters can there be that barring injury -this young man is going to be a generational force!
	🇨🇩
	❤️🔥
	21-60....
	💯💯💯💯💯
	🏀🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
	
	If they utilized this monster at the beginning maybe the spurs enters the playoffs. 
	Y’all believe these games are real nba players can’t score and let a team come back from 17 yall are some stupid mf people fr
	Wow a good win. Congrats guys.
	nasan yun kai sotto fanboys na mas magaling daw sya hahahah🤣

	The future!
