	Great Road Win For The Wolves
	3pm is already included in points scored  
	 I fully agree, they do it all the time
	 youre right,  31 points is 31 points regardless from which distance theyre made. 🤣
	 exactly.
	 Your right. The steals and blocks already added a ton, no need for a redundant add-on
	 They're pushing hard to make it equal to points, rebounds, assists, steals, &amp; blocks &amp; we just can't let it happen. It makes no sense, if anything include PER or something
	LOVE MY TEAM 🐺🐺🐺
	On only three ft attempts. He ain’t no ft merchant like a bunch of the other stars in this game. If the officials actually gave him the same treatment, he’d be averaging in the 30’s.
	💯
	He's the 007 of the nba. His play style is similar to MJs.
	Wolves should be on the top but  rigged the games. Not just wolves but the rest of the good teams they don’t want to be in the championship.
	 ahhh yes the nba rigging games so 2 bad teams make the finals aaaahhh
	 Did I said bad teams in the finals? Reading comprehension is very important but stay asleep. 🤣
	This guy is special!! I'm glad he's a wolf.
	Lowkey best player in the league right now!
	 people never seem to realize how important a players defense is. Other stars aren't lock down defenders like Edwards.
	 exactly he's one of the few that gives it his all on D too, and doesn't fold under pressure situations!
	This will not hold up in an a game 7 series
	Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Utah Jazz
	He stuffed the whole stat sheet. Came out to play
	He’s the most value player to his team
	He might make it in this league! 😉
	They should still be in first place.
	He will be an all time great for sure.
	They say there was no defense in this era but how about that?
	The Ant-Man 2
	Jordan he just young 🌱 now even Jordan needed time to develop now.
	I understand being the number seed in West means nothing to most.
	The GOAT on 💥💥
	It's a wonderful game.
	He did play so well.....
	Antman im action
	Mini jazz turned out well tonight…
	Ant is some talent..
	
	The real MVP
	🔥🔥
	
	“That’s it”
	Warriors beat lakers 128-121.
	that’s it? lmao!
	Anthony Edwards is a true blaller
	Light work 🐺🐺🐺
	He’s him
	Most improved or mvp conversation?
	Ballin in the mix
