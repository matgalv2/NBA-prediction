MIN	Great Road Win For The Wolves
MIN	3pm is already included in points scored
	Ricky Hill I fully agree, they do it all the time
	🤣
	Ricky Hill exactly.
	Ricky Hill Your right. The steals and blocks already added a ton, no need for a redundant add-on
	Ricky Hill They're pushing hard to make it equal to points, rebounds, assists, steals, &amp; blocks &amp; we just can't let it happen. It makes no sense, if anything include PER or something
MIN	LOVE MY TEAM 🐺🐺🐺
MIN	On only three ft attempts. He ain’t no ft merchant like a bunch of the other stars in this game. If the officials actually gave him the same treatment, he’d be averaging in the 30’s.
MIN	💯
MIN	He's the 007 of the nba. His play style is similar to MJs.
MIN	Wolves should be on the top but NBA rigged the games. Not just wolves but the rest of the good teams they don’t want to be in the championship.
	Lyn Sheng ahhh yes the nba rigging games so 2 bad teams make the finals aaaahhh
	🤣
MIN	This guy is special!! I'm glad he's a wolf.
MIN	Lowkey best player in the league right now!
	Ezequiel Carranza people never seem to realize how important a players defense is. Other stars aren't lock down defenders like Edwards.
MIN	Michael McFarland exactly he's one of the few that gives it his all on D too, and doesn't fold under pressure situations!
	This will not hold up in an a game 7 series
MIN	He’s the most value player to his team
	They should still be in first place.
MIN	He stuffed the whole stat sheet. Came out to play
MIN	He might make it in this league! 😉
	Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Utah Jazz
MIN	He will be an all time great for sure.
MIN	They say there was no defense in this era but how about that?
MIN	The Ant-Man 2
	Jordan he just young 🌱 now even Jordan needed time to develop now.
MIN	The GOAT on 💥💥
	I understand being the number seed in West means nothing to most.
