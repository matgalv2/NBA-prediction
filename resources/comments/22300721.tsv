MIA	Rafael Angulo You’ve been wrong all season long,facts only,the truth hurts. The Heat steamrolled right over you,the Magic aren’t even close to being a threat.
	Michael William Cassidy Nope. You have. You claimed we were at the bottom of the east when we could easily be top 6 in a couple games. You also said you locked up the 3 seed...you didnt. You also said the knicks would beat the magic....nope
