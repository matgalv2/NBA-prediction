	Michael William Cassidy  overreacting as usual. That was the definition of a trap game.
	Rafael Angulo The fact that you said it was a “very winnable game” and then got blown out is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀. You’re bad luck for your team man. Nothing you ever say is gonna happen ever happens LOL 💀
	Michael William Cassidy rent free
	Rafael Angulo You’ve been wrong all season long,facts only,the truth hurts. The Heat steamrolled right over you,the Magic aren’t even close to being a threat.
	Michael William Cassidy Nope. You have. You claimed we were at the bottom of the east when we could easily be top 6 in a couple games. You also said you locked up the 3 seed...you didnt. You also said the knicks would beat the magic....nope
	Michael William Cassidy knicks are no threat.
