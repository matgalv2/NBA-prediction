	Shaq mvp has 40 pt single.. while Luka easily having 40 point triple double every night
	Fox deserves more calls from the refs.
	He shot all free throws
	Shai is going the Harden and Embiid route. Never go the Harden and Embiid route.
	Hot hand from the FT line yeah

	 LeBron had a funny feeling that SGA was going to put up 40pts tonight
	Good job

	Aura
	What's with this picture, why is Jalen Brunson in the background? 🤔
	 Tino number twooooooo is mvp
	This guy is something special
	Only 4 assists, weak when compared to the real MVP Luka
	👋  Even though you beat my Knicks at the Garden
	Was he ever really injured?  Or did they just not want to face the warriors in the playoffs.  I wouldn't blame them.
	half man half free throws!
	Respeck to SGA. That Asian ref b having Asian eyes 😂 on Fox.
	Light skin Duke Dennis at the back
	20 free throw OK
	He put in extra 9 points.
	SGA never been left out

	Can OKC maintain this level in the playoffs??? That remains to be seen. Teams like OKC don't rise to the occasion like the playoffs when it really matters a lot.
	 mangtas kaayu ang goat
	Referee need to check his TRAVELLING… this fool travels a lot
	20 fta that's why luka is the real MVP SGA is a fraud

	Baka pag aabot ng playoffs
	The no call  travel the refs altered the game the same way the Kings got screwed over against Boston. Also the free throw differential between Fox and SGA is off the charts. It makes the  WWE look less scripted.

	 Lambert 😅
	SGA 4 MVP runner up. It’s a shame he’s in Jokic’s era. And Steph’s era before that.
