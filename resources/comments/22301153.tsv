	Fox deserves more calls from the refs.
	Shaq mvp has 40 pt single.. while Luka easily having 40 point triple double every night
	Jomar Cayaban tpos stat padder daw si luka parang harden samantalang ung SGA ung mala harden kase collector ng points sa free throw haha
	Phoejay Loven Cordero Dunlao edi palitan mo yung refs, kasalanan ba ng player kung mahirap siya bantayan? Bob0ls amp
	Jeffrey Gumbao Dicen ang poiny jan mga sga fans ngawa ng ngawa
	Jomar Cayaban Website to purchase OLD SCHOOL BMX BIKES bmxoldschoolbikes.com
	He shot all free throws
	Lambertoo Jojo and if they didn’t foul him he would of had the same lol
	Kelton Loomis free throw merchant
	Lambertoo Jojo nah you just a hater. He doesn’t foul himself bozo… just cause he really good free throw shooter doesn’t mean hate.
	Kelton Loomis check the stats all free throws. They should revise heading
	Lambertoo Jojo does he foul himself?
	Lambertoo Jojo does he blow the whistle for a shooting foul? He would score if they didn’t foul you clueless how bb works
	Kelton Loomis they should change the title to “hot hand at free throw line”
	Lambertoo Jojo Website to purchase OLD SCHOOL BMX BIKES bmxoldschoolbikes.com
	Hot hand from the FT line yeah
	Shai is going the Harden and Embiid route. Never go the Harden and Embiid route.

	My MVP 😍 🔥
	SGA by himself literally I kid you not shot 10X as many free throws as the Bucks and Celtics combined! Crazy stay but true.
	Joey McAteer then how does Giannis have the most free throw attempts for the 2024 season?
	Hannah Rose Brisolara yesterday Giannis shot 2 free throws SGA shot 20 that is literally 10 TIMES the amount of free throws. Foh but what I said is true and fact that Bucks and Celtics combined for 2 whole free throws meanwhile SGA shot 20 that’s 10x!
	Joey McAteer I see now that you are specifically speaking of yesterday’s game, but you didn’t state as such in your original comment. However, my statement is also true. Giannis has shot 780 free throw attempts total in 2024, and SGA has 610. Yet, many try and make SGA out to be the ft merchant. I’m just wondering why Giannis isn’t in this conversation?
	Hannah Rose Brisolara I feel like I made that connection pretty clear. That being said I also answered that already. 
	Joey McAteer he drives and forces fouls.. don't mean they have to foul him
	Aura
	What's with this picture, why is Jalen Brunson in the background? 🤔
	This guy is something special
	Faliana Tino number twooooooo is mvp
	👋  Even though you beat my Knicks at the Garden
	Was he ever really injured?  Or did they just not want to face the warriors in the playoffs.  I wouldn't blame them.
	Only 4 assists, weak when compared to the real MVP Luka
	Respeck to SGA. That Asian ref b having Asian eyes 😂 on Fox.
	half man half free throws!
	Light skin Duke Dennis at the back
	He put in extra 9 points.
	20 free throw OK
	The Lip💋 is back...
	SGA never been left out
	Kings are only good against lakers

	Can OKC maintain this level in the playoffs??? That remains to be seen. Teams like OKC don't rise to the occasion like the playoffs when it really matters a lot.

	The key is not the will to win, everybody has that. It is the will to prepare to win that is important, I have made more wins since I started trading with the help of Mr Luke Most people think buying the dip and holding is the only way to achieve success, I got rid of that mentality after I engaged in trading daily with Luke Maxwell
	Hey
	Fact is, Most people think buying the dip and holding is the only way to achieve success, I got rid of that mentality after I engaged in trading daily with  Fredrick Leonard

	The no call  travel the refs altered the game the same way the Kings got screwed over against Boston. Also the free throw differential between Fox and SGA is off the charts. It makes the  WWE look less scripted.

	SGA 4 MVP runner up. It’s a shame he’s in Jokic’s era. And Steph’s era before that.
