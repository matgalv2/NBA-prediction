TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Warriors becoming legit late in the season.
	Steph Curry's name should be mentioned in the MVP category. This man is the greatest shooter of all time and GSW is gelling at the right moment.
	Congratulations 🎊 👏 To my Team! The Warriors 👏👏👏
	Oh My God 😯 Wow! 🙏👍👏 Congratulations Warrior's! You Guys The Best Players Ever! 💯👌🏀🏀🏀🏆🏆🏆😍😍😍 Good Luck With Praying For The Next Game, 🙏🤞👏👏👍
	Awesome victory GSW! Congrats! 🎉🏀👏
	They've been winning against mostly depleted teams. I'll say that they're legit again if they win against Boston on the road.
	It feels good when the warriors win 🏆 love ❤️ it go warrior 💛💙💛💙💛💙
	that is gsw basketball 🏀
	Great work steph
	Awesome win Steph.
	Warriors bouncing back🔥
	I like the way that Jonathan Kuminga progress this season. Go ahead and stay your self champions. Great job Steph.
	Paterne Baluge Nice
	Spizes Yeah.
	Great player (the mumbler, he seems so uncomfortable talking in interview and camera, not terrible thing, but he is supposed to one of the faces of the NBA) and according to all the analyst (Stephen A), the greatest shooter and scorer ever, but will he ever score 40K in his NBA career?  More than a guy who is a pass first guy and not a great scorer, (hmm, I cannot remember his name right now, but he is the current leading scorer in NBA history!)!
	Are we sleeping on Kuminga?
	No one is sleeping on him dude, he’s already good asf and he’s only 21
	Great balanced team win on the road back to back with zero sleep.  That was an amazing win considering the ridiculous travel logistics that preceded the game.
	Winning the road and depth of the bench are the one missing last season,the young players are stepping up bigtime to take the load off Steph on the remaining games of the season.
	Despite the fact they didn't even sleep when they landed due to a mechanic issue with the plane before they left New York.
	Peaking at the right time after a hurdle of injuries, egos and internal problems looks like Warriors finally rwalizing who they are and what their individual roles on the team are.
	The GSW are getting heated up as we approach Play-offs, I bet no one can beat this team in a 7 series game as it stands it's 50/50 as it stands
	Steph is no longer the old Steph. He has out in a lot of great work on himself and i think he's far more better and I'm sure the team are not ready to lose him at all
	They are a 4x champion for a reason go warriors!
	Curry 🔥 ❤️💪
	What a night for the Golden State Warriors to win, with a huge win for Stephen Curry and Jonathan Kuminga in the 120-105 win against the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 NBA Finals Rematch
	Darren Joseph Martinez thanks for repeating the post lol
	If the Golden State Warriors clinch a spot in the playoffs, the NBA will be in trouble. 🔥💪🏼💙💛
