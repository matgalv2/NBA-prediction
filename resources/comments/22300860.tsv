TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
GSW	Warriors becoming legit late in the season.
GSW	Steph Curry's name should be mentioned in the MVP category. This man is the greatest shooter of all time and GSW is gelling at the right moment.
GSW	Congratulations 🎊 👏 To my Team! The Warriors 👏👏👏
GSW	Oh My God 😯 Wow! 🙏👍👏 Congratulations Warrior's! You Guys The Best Players Ever! 💯👌🏀🏀🏀🏆🏆🏆😍😍😍 Good Luck With Praying For The Next Game, 🙏🤞👏👏👍
GSW	Awesome victory GSW! Congrats! 🎉🏀👏
GSW	They've been winning against mostly depleted teams. I'll say that they're legit again if they win against Boston on the road.
GSW	It feels good when the warriors win 🏆 love ❤️ it go warrior 💛💙💛💙💛💙
GSW	that is gsw basketball 🏀
GSW	Great work steph
GSW	Awesome win Steph.
GSW	Warriors bouncing back🔥
GSW	I like the way that Jonathan Kuminga progress this season. Go ahead and stay your self champions. Great job Steph.
GSW	Paterne Baluge Nice
GSW	Spizes Yeah.
GSW	Great player (the mumbler, he seems so uncomfortable talking in interview and camera, not terrible thing, but he is supposed to one of the faces of the NBA) and according to all the analyst (Stephen A), the greatest shooter and scorer ever, but will he ever score 40K in his NBA career?  More than a guy who is a pass first guy and not a great scorer, (hmm, I cannot remember his name right now, but he is the current leading scorer in NBA history!)!
GSW	Are we sleeping on Kuminga?
GSW	No one is sleeping on him dude, he’s already good asf and he’s only 21
GSW	Great balanced team win on the road back to back with zero sleep.  That was an amazing win considering the ridiculous travel logistics that preceded the game.
GSW	Winning the road and depth of the bench are the one missing last season,the young players are stepping up bigtime to take the load off Steph on the remaining games of the season.
GSW	Despite the fact they didn't even sleep when they landed due to a mechanic issue with the plane before they left New York.
GSW	Peaking at the right time after a hurdle of injuries, egos and internal problems looks like Warriors finally rwalizing who they are and what their individual roles on the team are.
GSW	The GSW are getting heated up as we approach Play-offs, I bet no one can beat this team in a 7 series game as it stands it's 50/50 as it stands
GSW	Steph is no longer the old Steph. He has out in a lot of great work on himself and i think he's far more better and I'm sure the team are not ready to lose him at all
GSW	They are a 4x champion for a reason go warriors!
GSW	Curry 🔥 ❤️💪
GSW	What a night for the Golden State Warriors to win, with a huge win for Stephen Curry and Jonathan Kuminga in the 120-105 win against the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 NBA Finals Rematch
	Darren Joseph Martinez thanks for repeating the post lol
GSW	If the Golden State Warriors clinch a spot in the playoffs, the NBA will be in trouble. 🔥💪🏼💙💛
