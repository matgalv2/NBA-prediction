TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Great Wiliamson and Valančiūnas performances. Congratulations Pelicans team on the victory!
	LeBron never did this kind of stats in his entire career, that's why Zion is better than bron 🤷
	I'm starting to believe the Detroit sports gods sacrificed the Pistons so the Lions can have an excellent season 👏
	Kourtney L. Terry definitely what happened coming from a Detroit fan
	😂
	Kourtney L. Terry lmao yea it's sad man cuz basketball is my favorite sport but in turn I've seen the pistons win a title in my life never seen the lions this good tho so it's bitter sweet but I think fair trade if lions can can get a title
	From one sports fan to another.
	Kourtney L. Terry you yoo sir Pelicans looking good this year zion is definitely him
	You beat a 12 win team. 🔥
	We'll meet in the playoffs my boys 🫡
	Fire your refs, all of them. They're making it obvious this year that they're taking money under the table with some of these T's. The NBA has become a joke to watch 🤷
	Average day for Luka
	Thats what I want to see from NBA player.
