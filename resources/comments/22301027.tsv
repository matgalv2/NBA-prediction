	Great Wiliamson and Valančiūnas performances. Congratulations Pelicans team on the victory!
	LeBron never did this kind of stats in his entire career, that's why Zion is better than bron 🤷
	 LEBRON HAS 30 20 10 LAST TIME THEY FACE GSW
	 AND ALSO LEBRON WON ROOKIE OF THE YEAR AND ZION DIDN'T
	I'm starting to believe the Detroit sports gods sacrificed the Pistons so the Lions can have an excellent season 👏
	 definitely what happened coming from a Detroit fan
	 I'm a Pelicans fan. When I told this to a Pistons fan when they played the Pelicans back in New Orleans, he started laughing!😂
	 lmao yea it's sad man cuz basketball is my favorite sport but in turn I've seen the pistons win a title in my life never seen the lions this good tho so it's bitter sweet but I think fair trade if lions can can get a title
	From one sports fan to another.
	 you yoo sir Pelicans looking good this year zion is definitely him
	You beat a 12 win team. 🔥
	Matthew Scharff the same team who also beat OKC and the Kings yep
	 Should they have lost to them instead?
	 and they’ll beat your team, too 🔥🔥
	 that's hate
	 yes we did!  Your point
	 They beat 43 other teams before them. What's your point?
	 how many wins the hornets got?
	 a win is a win
	We'll meet in the playoffs my boys 🫡
	Fire your refs, all of them. They're making it obvious this year that they're taking money under the table with some of these T's. The NBA has become a joke to watch 🤷
	Zion the extra rice master
	Only know dunks
	Average day for Luka
	 yea ball hogging
	 Luka's highest FG in a game is only 81% try again bud 😌
	Thats what I want to see from NBA player.
