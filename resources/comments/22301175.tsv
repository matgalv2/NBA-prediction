	Still, Lakers will be the champion.
	Good playmaker-guard,  the best  L. Doncic's teammate.
	Luka somewhere in North Texas punching the air rn!
	: Why would he? Brunson is averaging 28/3/6, Kyrie is averaging 25/5/5, on 50/40/90 splits. He's good.
	Lmao the last post said he had 5 straight games of 35+ points now they drop it to 30🤣
	 still balling 🤷‍♂️
	Let’s apply laker logic to this post, “barely won tho, against one of the worst teams in the league” there, Lebron haters would be proud.
	He is a God … the pride I feel … the Knicks are finally good and still he is disrespected with MVP votes … I CANNOT wait for the playoffs… I just want to see a deep run if we lose against the Celtics in the semis… I’ll take it … but FINALLY… we are relevant … have been waiting for too long
	He is the people's MVP
	The definition of MVP
	Those assists are starting to be steadily around 10 per game
	Brooklyn Nets Vs New York Knicks
	The knicks AVATAR
	Phenomenon Player
