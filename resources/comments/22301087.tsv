	Salim Seven the Celtics definitely won the regular season chip
	Jim Arnold ty hope it turns out better then the Bucks last year.
	Sael Mirasolo don’t know about that but you definitely regular season champs
	Jim Arnold 2nd is still good.
	Sael Mirasolo all I know is Boston is numberer 1 as far as regular season goes
	Just hope the celtics don't get knocked out of the first round like last years regular season champs.
	Jim Arnold what are your Bucks doing?
	Sael Mirasolo they are not going to win the regular season championship for sure. That is definitely the Celtics this year
	Sael Mirasolo congratulations

	Ozzy Garcia sure
BOS	😂
	Jr Victorino nah Hauser better
	Jr Victorino bro he’s had big games this season if you haven’t been watching the C’s, he’s like Duncan Robinson from the heat.
	Ozzy Garcia but way better on the defensive side
BOS	Celtics are them play offs favorites
BOS	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate just love #Lebron not a Goat nor a king 💪
