	This will make Celtic’s fan mad but congratulations on being regular season champions
	 Yo what’s up champ 🥇
	 don’t know about that but congratulations on being regular season champs
	 tough being a bucks fan.
	 don’t know about that but congratulations on Celtics regular season championship
	 he posts tik toks all day. He’s just wanting attention 🥱
	 Whose fan are you?
	 someone who just is actually amazed by Celtics regular season chip
	 Can you add me as a friend?
	 when your team is being slaughtered first round by Miami😂
	 don’t know about that but Celtics definitely regular season champs
	 and soon to get banner number 18 how many y’all got?? 😂💀
	 all you can do is copy paste🙂
	 Coming from a bucks fan? Nah. Boston owns Milwaukee since 1974 lol
	 don’t know if that true but you definitely beat the bucks by a lot to win regular season championships
	 only 1 team can win the chip so what what make rest of the teams
	 the Celtics definitely won the regular season chip
	 ty hope it turns out better then the Bucks last year.
	 don’t know about that but you definitely regular season champs
	 2nd is still good.
	 all I know is Boston is numberer 1 as far as regular season goes
	Just hope the celtics don't get knocked out of the first round like last years regular season champs.
	 what are your Bucks doing?
	 they are not going to win the regular season championship for sure. That is definitely the Celtics this year
	 congratulations
	 you know it buddy.
	 I'm starting to get worried for the Bucks.
	 absolutely!
	 yikes the wizards.
	 Do you like Doc Rivers better then Adrian?
	This guy better be in playoff rotation
	 sure
	 thought that was Gordon Hayward 😂
	Jr Victorino nah Hauser better
	 bro he’s had big games this season if you haven’t been watching the C’s, he’s like Duncan Robinson from the heat.
	 but way better on the defensive side
	Celtics are them play offs favorites
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate just love <a class=
	if you are desperate for attention, just hate Lebron!
	 🔥🔥🔥
	 str8 facts
	 lol lebron just hit 9 3s yesterday is this an April fools statement 🙂
	 no hate just love 🤣
	Sam can blaze the nets 🏀☘️🔥
	Boston can't be stopped easily
	He had a great game tonight too. 1 for18. Yes, I said 1 for 18. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Miles Bridges Stats 🔥
	 Yo what’s up champ 🥇
	Good job to the Celtics
	Boston Celtics  will win the Chip this season
	 Yo what’s up champ 🥇
	 keep dreaming
	be ready for physical game in the Playoffs..maybe Regular Season is just a game of 3's
	 nice one coach 😂😂😂
	Looks like prime Larry Bird if he played today.
	We need to get it together before the playoffs. Anyway good win
	the Boston win NBA
	Boston Celtics Vs Charlotte Hornets
	Hauser most improved player this season.
	Gordon Hayward back in Celtics?
	we will see in the finale whos team to become a champion in 2023-24 season,..the standing is just a number,.when playoffs coming,back to zero again,.
	Wow the  did their thing ☘️😍🥰🏆😎💯🤙🤩🔥
	Sam is a sharpshooter ☘️
	Hauser is going to demand a lot of money after this season and get it! The boy is shooting lights out, and he’s our best 3pt shooter there I said it!!!
	 Celtics have a club option on him that’s only 2 million for next season. Celtics are definitely picking that up. He’s an UFA the summer of 2025.
	 Danm only $2Mil, the Celtics definitely needs to lock him up after 2025 then. He’s also good on D!!! Houser has been on a tear lately and at the right time!!!
	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪
	let’s go boys 🍀🍀🍀
	exciting competition.🏀🏀🏀
	Tapos

	 Waw ha, paano mo nsbi yan, manghuhula  k b?

	All these wins just to lose to us in the ECF 🫶🏽
	Splash Hauser 🔥
	Celtics are a TEAM everyone does their part that’s what￼ I love about them.  Hogging the ball is not for them. 🍀🍀🍀💚💚
	I'm never gonna win on draft kings if random mfs keep balling 🤣
	Instead of having brown or tstum messing up for the last possession set up a play for hauser to shoot a 3
	Hornets gave them a tough time fr 
	Gordon Haywards doppelganger.
	 Sam's ankle is healthy
	 Yo what’s up champ 🥇
