	The season is coming to an end teams knowing they won’t make the playoffs going to put up a fight still 😶‍🌫️ ..
	Farm teams
	 Ano to PBA? Ayos ka lang?
	How can we support a team who always tank instead of fighting up to the last quarter , talents are wasted by this non sense tanking
	 Detroit isn’t trust me, there GM is just horrible and doesn’t have a clue.
	 they need to be more motivated and aggressive,they have a very good players and they are keeping it up
	 I used to hate Tinking too, but when you think about it, how can small market teams like Detroit build a winning team without tanking and without draft capital?
	5ast and 8/10 ft is a super underrated part of his game
	 he's a modern day young Dwight Howard with better shooting. At 20yrs, his future looks bright. Think he can learn to shoot 3s like isaiah Stewart?  If he does 😵‍💫
	Honestly, his FT shooting can be a good enough strength to keep him playing a traditional C role. Floor spacing and shooting is a good trait to have in the modern NBA, but his FT shooting and defense means he’s not a liability
	Too many dunks on a team on tanking , will give soft defence and numerous turnover, its normal and shameful to Raptors
	BOOM💥💥💥
	Tank is on for a top 6 pick or better!
	Business continues in Raptors , poor team
	Sb4, in year 4, will bring Raptors back to glory 🫡
	At what age will Durant retire?
	
	👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

	I said awhile back the Pistons have good players they’re just a bad team. Well, it looks like some of those players are stepping up.
	 they are just very young and will only get better.
	 I always say that too ,they really have a good players it’s just a bad team at this time for the pistons.
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	On 313 Day too. GO PISTONS 🏀🏀🏀
	Pistons finally figuring it out?
	 Another L for your guys RJ and IQ,I told you man.
	 RJ was out
	 IQ played
	  samething what philly did to us
	 We steamrolled the Sixers last game.
	 yea and the gaje before
	 we didn’t have OG
	 and they didnt have RJ so now you see that you delusional
	 They’ve been losing games with RJ though that’s the difference. RJ and IQ are not difference makers.
	G-League at the highest level!! 🤣
	Mga walang kwentang team nagharap na wala na pag asa sa playoffs,,,haahhaa
	How do we play an inspired effort against the Champs with no starters than shit the bed against the pistons
	The RJ Barrett effect…😭
	 you got IQ in the trade also, he’s growing up nicely. I miss IQ.
	 I’m a mavs fan 🤩 we got the mvp
	 oh, never mind. I’m a Knicks fan. And yeah, Luka’s solid. But I think they’ll give it to Shai this year. Mostly because the thunder are in first.
	 was out. And he has been a bright spot for us.
	Thanks Piston for the win! Got 2.55 odds on moneyline. Cash out bruh!! 💰
