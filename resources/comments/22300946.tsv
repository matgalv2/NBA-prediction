TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The season is coming to an end teams knowing they won’t make the playoffs going to put up a fight still 😶‍🌫️ ..
	Farm teams
	Patrick Mercado Ano to PBA? Ayos ka lang?
	How can we support a team who always tank instead of fighting up to the last quarter , talents are wasted by this non sense tanking
	Ranz Aquino Detroit isn’t trust me, there GM is just horrible and doesn’t have a clue.
	Ranz Aquino they need to be more motivated and aggressive,they have a very good players and they are keeping it up
	Ranz Aquino I used to hate Tinking too, but when you think about it, how can small market teams like Detroit build a winning team without tanking and without draft capital?
	Too many dunks on a team on tanking , will give soft defence and numerous turnover, its normal and shameful to Raptors
	5ast and 8/10 ft is a super underrated part of his game
	😵‍💫
	Honestly, his FT shooting can be a good enough strength to keep him playing a traditional C role. Floor spacing and shooting is a good trait to have in the modern NBA, but his FT shooting and defense means he’s not a liability
	Tank is on for a top 6 pick or better!
	Business continues in Raptors , poor team
	Sb4, in year 4, will bring Raptors back to glory 🫡
	BOOM💥💥💥
	At what age will Durant retire?
	Leonardo Class
	👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

	I said awhile back the Pistons have good players they’re just a bad team. Well, it looks like some of those players are stepping up.
	Mike Trout they are just very young and will only get better.
	Mike Trout I always say that too ,they really have a good players it’s just a bad team at this time for the pistons.
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	On 313 Day too. GO PISTONS 🏀🏀🏀
	Pistons finally figuring it out?
	Chito Rock Another L for your guys RJ and IQ,I told you man.
	Michael William Cassidy RJ was out
	Chito Rock IQ played
	Michael William Cassidy  samething what philly did to us
	Chito Rock We steamrolled the Sixers last game.
	Michael William Cassidy yea and the gaje before
	Chito Rock we didn’t have OG
	Michael William Cassidy and they didnt have RJ so now you see that you delusional
	Chito Rock They’ve been losing games with RJ though that’s the difference. RJ and IQ are not difference makers.
	G-League at the highest level!! 🤣
	Mga walang kwentang team nagharap na wala na pag asa sa playoffs,,,haahhaa

	Thanks Piston for the win! Got 2.55 odds on moneyline. Cash out bruh!! 💰
	The RJ Barrett effect…😭
	Brandon Palmer you got IQ in the trade also, he’s growing up nicely. I miss IQ.
	🤩 we got the mvp
	Brandon Palmer oh, never mind. I’m a Knicks fan. And yeah, Luka’s solid. But I think they’ll give it to Shai this year. Mostly because the thunder are in first.
	Brandon Palmer was out. And he has been a bright spot for us.
	Jalen Duren
	How do we play an inspired effort against the Champs with no starters than shit the bed against the pistons
	That's my boy!
	Jalen Duren
