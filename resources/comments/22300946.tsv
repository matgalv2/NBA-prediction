TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The season is coming to an end teams knowing they won’t make the playoffs going to put up a fight still 😶‍🌫️ ..
	Farm teams
	Patrick Mercado Ano to PBA? Ayos ka lang?
TOR	How can we support a team who always tank instead of fighting up to the last quarter , talents are wasted by this non sense tanking
DET	Ranz Aquino Detroit isn’t trust me, there GM is just horrible and doesn’t have a clue.
DET	Ranz Aquino they need to be more motivated and aggressive,they have a very good players and they are keeping it up
DET	Ranz Aquino I used to hate Tinking too, but when you think about it, how can small market teams like Detroit build a winning team without tanking and without draft capital?
TOR	Too many dunks on a team on tanking , will give soft defence and numerous turnover, its normal and shameful to Raptors
DET	5ast and 8/10 ft is a super underrated part of his game
	😵‍💫
DET	Honestly, his FT shooting can be a good enough strength to keep him playing a traditional C role. Floor spacing and shooting is a good trait to have in the modern NBA, but his FT shooting and defense means he’s not a liability
TOR	Tank is on for a top 6 pick or better!
TOR	Business continues in Raptors , poor team
TOR	Sb4, in year 4, will bring Raptors back to glory 🫡
DET	BOOM💥💥💥
	At what age will Durant retire?
	Leonardo Class
	👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

DET	I said awhile back the Pistons have good players they’re just a bad team. Well, it looks like some of those players are stepping up.
DET	Mike Trout they are just very young and will only get better.
DET	Mike Trout I always say that too ,they really have a good players it’s just a bad team at this time for the pistons.
TOR	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
DET	On 313 Day too. GO PISTONS 🏀🏀🏀
DET	Pistons finally figuring it out?
DET	Chito Rock Another L for your guys RJ and IQ,I told you man.
TOR	Michael William Cassidy RJ was out
TOR	Chito Rock IQ played
TOR	Michael William Cassidy  samething what philly did to us
	Chito Rock We steamrolled the Sixers last game.
	Michael William Cassidy yea and the gaje before
TOR	Chito Rock we didn’t have OG
TOR	Michael William Cassidy and they didnt have RJ so now you see that you delusional
TOR	Chito Rock They’ve been losing games with RJ though that’s the difference. RJ and IQ are not difference makers.
	G-League at the highest level!! 🤣
	Mga walang kwentang team nagharap na wala na pag asa sa playoffs,,,haahhaa
	Beast
DET	Thanks Piston for the win! Got 2.55 odds on moneyline. Cash out bruh!! 💰
TOR	The RJ Barrett effect…😭
TOR	Brandon Palmer you got IQ in the trade also, he’s growing up nicely. I miss IQ.
	🤩 we got the mvp
	Brandon Palmer oh, never mind. I’m a Knicks fan. And yeah, Luka’s solid. But I think they’ll give it to Shai this year. Mostly because the thunder are in first.
	Brandon Palmer was out. And he has been a bright spot for us.
DET	Jalen Duren
TOR	How do we play an inspired effort against the Champs with no starters than shit the bed against the pistons
	That's my boy!
DET	Jalen Duren
DET	Way chance
DET	Free wing stop boys back to back
DET	Detroit has beat the raptors twice. The raptors are beyond bums lol. Have given detroit 1/6 of their wins lol
