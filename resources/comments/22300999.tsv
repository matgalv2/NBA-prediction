	The NBA. It's the biggest joke in sports. The players have no class. They don't follow their rules. The commissioner let them get away with murder. The NBA was classic League back in the 1980s. They are an embarrassment to this country. Sadly.
	Robert James 80’s when they were all on coke and acting gangster?
	Guy Farrell Not the good players. And they had class and respect for people. Not like these players today. The commissioner has no control. Not even close and it's gonna get worse in all sports. Sadly.
	Robert James sad perspective. There are plenty of great people playing today.
	As they should
