TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Great game
	The whole team was on fire
	And another triple double by the league leader, non All-Star, Sabonis.
	Kings cleared the bench 2 minutes into the 4th. It was a slaughter.
	Such a great team effort🏀
	Sabonis*

	You know it’s a slaughter fest when you see Slawson and Colby Jones on the floor
	The NBA. It's the biggest joke in sports. The players have no class. They don't follow their rules. The commissioner let them get away with murder. The NBA was classic League back in the 1980s. They are an embarrassment to this country. Sadly.
	 80’s when they were all on coke and acting gangster?
	 Not the good players. And they had class and respect for people. Not like these players today. The commissioner has no control. Not even close and it's gonna get worse in all sports. Sadly.
	 sad perspective. There are plenty of great people playing today.
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	As they should
