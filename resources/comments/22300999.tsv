TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Great game
	The whole team was on fire
	And another triple double by the league leader, non All-Star, Sabonis.
	Kings cleared the bench 2 minutes into the 4th. It was a slaughter.
	Such a great team effort🏀
	Regular season team lol
	Martin Wallace dumb comment lol

	You know it’s a slaughter fest when you see Slawson and Colby Jones on the floor
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	The NBA. It's the biggest joke in sports. The players have no class. They don't follow their rules. The commissioner let them get away with murder. The NBA was classic League back in the 1980s. They are an embarrassment to this country. Sadly.
	Robert James 80’s when they were all on coke and acting gangster?
	Guy Farrell Not the good players. And they had class and respect for people. Not like these players today. The commissioner has no control. Not even close and it's gonna get worse in all sports. Sadly.
	Robert James sad perspective. There are plenty of great people playing today.
	As they should
	I’m Giving out “5” grand to the first “6” people to message me with “FAITH” cus I feel some people going through difficulties this year, y’all stay blessed.
	"Season greetings y'all l'm gifting 5 grands to the first 7 people to message me with 🎄🎅""GOD DID”let's spread love and end inhumanity stay blessed 😇 yall 🎚️🎄🏆"
