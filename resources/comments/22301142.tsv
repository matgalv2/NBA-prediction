	 jazz ain’t nothing compared to the 
	Nice work, klay
	Warriors are playing well just in time as a team prepare for their play in game.
	The Rock win and here Klay win also...
	Twice this year Klay 🤣
	Congrats Dub nations good job Warriors for life.
	Congrats warriors very good winner
	I don't see any way the Jazz make the playoffs this year.
	Great job. But We need him to be more consistent 🙌🏽
	Yall need to put some respect on Klay
	How many stars does Utah have ?
	His last season
	Great day... Warriors win, lakers lose😆😆
	Keep on winning...next is Lakers..!!!
	 sure they will beat lakers
	If this is happening and the big 3 is playing like in championship level.Then warriors are getting scary 😮😮
	The warriors best shooter
	Good for him because he won't be on GSW next season
	warriors vs lakerz next game easy win for lake show
	Warriors win
	 lakers game ain’t over yet
	Arriba Warriors bendiciones Klay

	Congrats Warriors 
	A Great Performance by my Guy 🔥💜
	Good work My boy Klay 🔵🟡🔵🟡🙌🙌🏀🏀playing good ball Boyz
	useless win to a g league team still 10th seed🤣🤣
	Sin el Cheff Curry en el quintecto como guard ganaron a un equipo que no eh tan temible y ete equipo sin Curry eta temporada en cancha tiene récord de 2-5 récord muy malo su primera Victoria fue el 11 de marzo de este Año ahora sin Klay Thompson tiene 4-0 eta temporada papel y lapiz cuando klay Thompson anota 30 más puntos los Warriors tiene récord de por vida de 67-11
	He looks strong when the opponents are weak if its strong team lol 😂😂😂
	 not really, remember how he slaughtered rockets and heat
	 lol rockets and heat are weak team look at the standings😆😂😅if that mavs or teams from the top I will say that klay is back but if its this lol never😂😂😂
	 You forgot that gsw defeated mavs in their first game in this season with luka
	 lol oh that did u watch it?lol they got lucky that day lol haha
	 ah so you want that huh, swerte din Lakers sa bucks at Cavs🤪
	 si mirastés los dos partidos contra Dallas .  Tienes algo negativo que decir?
	 lol gsw fans aq badtrip lng aq sa mga talo nila mga sabaw haha
	  ahora dime qué pasó con tu nena creo que todavía no la han encontrado porque desapareció de miedo
	I wouldn’t reward Klay with a big contract!! Really he hasn’t done much, his game suppose to start at the beginning on the season…Klay shows up at the second half… Nawww not consistent enough to convince me that he’s a consistent, I mean a consistent player… He had a good game with the Jazz, the night before he had maybe 15 points… Inconsistently is a big problem! You don’t know which Klay   will show up!!! I’m from the show me State!!
	Great job, congratulations!
	Over 227.5😋😋😋
	Congrats Warriors 👏 👍 👏
	what a nice day😍👏
	He was 🔥🔥
	10 seed!! Let’s go! 🤣 but tbh, happy the Lakers are moving to 8 because a play in with them would involve them scoring 30+ free throws 🫠
	 and now down 15 heading to the 3rd qrter vs twolves
	 and now down 5
	 and now down 10 heading to the 4th 😂🤭
	
	 panis
	 warriors could never be half the franchise the 17x🏆 Lakers are
	 but not in lebrons time only 1 🤭
	.5 ring bubble season
	 no ring bubble season
	 binababoy na lakers mo sa 4th ngayon
	 warriors no playoffs for you 🤣🤣🤣
	 smell you later bandwagon
	Jeffrey Skyler Debban still crying about the free throw but they shoot three almost the whole game.
	 Couldn't agree more with the +30FTs if they compete against baby boy Lakers.
	 you’re 100% right
	 seriously.
	 they're back to 9th now after the loss today. 😆
	 lakers vs warriors now
	 well stop fouling them
	 top tier casual 🤣
	 but the Lakers are the 9 seed and don't have the tie breaker with Sacramento
	Si curry nag papabuhat na naman 😌
	
	This doesn’t change the fact that Roman Reigns was robbed of the WWE championship.
	 grow up its fake
	 same as tv shows
	 it’s not fake. It’s not real. It’s scripted. But they f’d this ending up like how I do your mom, doggy style, no lube.
	Nice
	 it’s not fake Cena and taker coming back it’s not fake
	My guy it’s all fake grow up
	 about time
	 That just an act 🤣🤣
	 it's all fixed
	I love. It love it
	 they are awesome
	No steph no problem good luck guys next stop in 
	Darrell Lucañas  They arent in the playoffs but yeah good luck guys
	 no Clarkson
	 well ya. They were playing in a jazz tryout game. Lol
	 yeah no greatest choker no problem
	LaCoste is the problem!
	Warriors all the way

	And yall really said get rid of Klay. Sad how after all he’s done for the organization ya’ll are so quick to turn on him. And same with Draymond. It’s supposed to be us against the world. The whole league can hate dray but us warriors fans need to <a tabindex= go Klay he’s always been my favorite player in history other than curry
	For those that still doubt Klay 👌🏾🔥🏀 splash 💦
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
