	Klay making Joe think about that new contract. Keep going Klay!  Make them break the bank but by all means we need you to put up at least 25 per game!!
	Congratulations Klay 🎉🎊❤️
	Very difficult to get a win against the Jazz. Well done!
	Nice work, klay
	The Rock win and here Klay win also...
	Warriors are playing well just in time as a team prepare for their play in game.
	Congrats Dub nations good job Warriors for life.
	Twice this year Klay 🤣
	Congrats warriors very good winner
	No steph no problem good luck guys next stop in #LakeShow
	Darrell Lucañas no Clarkson
	I don't see any way the Jazz make the playoffs this year.
	Great job. But We need him to be more consistent 🙌🏽
	Great day... Warriors win, lakers lose😆😆
	If this is happening and the big 3 is playing like in championship level.Then warriors are getting scary 😮😮
	How many stars does Utah have ?
	Yall need to put some respect on Klay
	The warriors best shooter
	Warriors win
	warriors vs lakerz next game easy win for lake show
	Ample James are u sure?
	Good for him because he won't be on GSW next season
	This doesn’t change the fact that Roman Reigns was robbed of the WWE championship.
	Still needs consistency and continues to climb to playoff, every win game matters 👍👏🏀
	Secured play in spot 👏 congrats 🎉

	Good work My boy Klay 🔵🟡🔵🟡🙌🙌🏀🏀playing good ball Boyz
	useless win to a g league team still 10th seed🤣🤣
	I love. It love it
	I wouldn’t reward Klay with a big contract!! Really he hasn’t done much, his game suppose to start at the beginning on the season…Klay shows up at the second half… Nawww not consistent enough to convince me that he’s a consistent, I mean a consistent player… He had a good game with the Jazz, the night before he had maybe 15 points… Inconsistently is a big problem! You don’t know which Klay   will show up!!! I’m from the show me State!!
	He looks strong when the opponents are weak if its strong team lol 😂😂😂
	Great job, congratulations!
	Congrats Warriors 👏 👍 👏
	what a nice day😍👏
	He was 🔥🔥
	10 seed!! Let’s go! 🤣 but tbh, happy the Lakers are moving to 8 because a play in with them would involve them scoring 30+ free throws 🫠

	Warriors all the way
	As a warriors fan I wish they lost.
	Yay, congrats dubs !
	Congratulations Warriors
	Wish he had hot hand in last game 🙁

	Congrats
	❤️❤️❤️
	Great job. But We need him to be more consistent 🙌🏽
	And yall really said get rid of Klay. Sad how after all he’s done for the organization ya’ll are so quick to turn on him. And same with Draymond. It’s supposed to be us against the world. The whole league can hate dray but us warriors fans need to always have our guys back till the wheels fall off💯 go Klay he’s always been my favorite player in history other than curry
	For those that still doubt Klay 👌🏾🔥🏀 splash 💦
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Way to go warriors 🥹!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Lets goo warriors 🏀⛹️‍♂️⛹️
	Let's go warriors
	Open spot to 11 seed 😁😁😁
