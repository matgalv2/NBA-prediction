GSW	useless win to a g league team still 10th seed🤣🤣
GSW	I love. It love it
GSW	I wouldn’t reward Klay with a big contract!! Really he hasn’t done much, his game suppose to start at the beginning on the season…Klay shows up at the second half… Nawww not consistent enough to convince me that he’s a consistent, I mean a consistent player… He had a good game with the Jazz, the night before he had maybe 15 points… Inconsistently is a big problem! You don’t know which Klay   will show up!!! I’m from the show me State!!
GSW	He looks strong when the opponents are weak if its strong team lol 😂😂😂
GSW	Great job, congratulations!
GSW	Congrats Warriors 👏 👍 👏
GSW	what a nice day😍👏
GSW	He was 🔥🔥
	10 seed!! Let’s go! 🤣 but tbh, happy the Lakers are moving to 8 because a play in with them would involve them scoring 30+ free throws 🫠

GSW	Great job. But We need him to be more consistent 🙌🏽
GSW	And yall really said get rid of Klay. Sad how after all he’s done for the organization ya’ll are so quick to turn on him. And same with Draymond. It’s supposed to be us against the world. The whole league can hate dray but us warriors fans need to always have our guys back till the wheels fall off💯 go Klay he’s always been my favorite player in history other than curry
GSW	For those that still doubt Klay 👌🏾🔥🏀 splash 💦
GSW	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
