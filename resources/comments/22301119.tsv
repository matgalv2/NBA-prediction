TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Such a great player for a guy who used to work at Dominoes
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	👑👑👑👑🏀🏀🏀🏀😁😁😁😁
	Love Green, was sad to see he was demoted. Happy he’s back, needs a contract for next season.
	Bryan E. Thomas should have been with team all year great hustle Vuc a cancer get rid of him he doesn't like anyone on team but Derozan
	Ernest Hayes yeah he plays hard every day. Surely there is a full roster spot for a guy that plays hard.
	This is where we missed Julius.
	Shawn Johnson bruh I was cussing bogdanovic out man single handedly costed them -10 points ...2 turnovers in the 4th and he was committing dumb fouls all some how in limited minutes...
	Shawn Johnson  Brunson being your best player right now … means the Knicks  can’t win…
	TOMMY LEVESTON He’s doing everything he can.  Not his fault the refs hate the Knicks.
	Happy like a kid in the play ground. 👏
	Derozan and Zack can’t play together. When Zack not playing this time looks so much better
	💪💪💪💪
	Don't release him again. This time he deserves to stay on the Chicago Bulls
	there's 5 javontes out there!
	A random guy good job
	My new favorite Bull Dennis Schroder.. 😂😂😂😂
	Dennis schroder 27pts Brooklyn nets yan e haha
	Congratulations!!!! good job wish the C's would have kept him
	Should’ve never got rid of him
	How much I miss the Bulls during the Jordan era
	Excellent work
	great for Scroeder. 😂😂😂
	if he stays healthy this stats is permanent to him
	🏃🏾‍♂️
	❤️❤️❤️
	lol Dennis Schroder? Don’t he play for Brooklyn or I’m tripping? Lmaoo and you know Green deserves a shout out not just for the stats but he got kicked in the head by Josh hart this game 😂😂
