TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
CHI	Such a great player for a guy who used to work at Dominoes
CHI	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
CHI	👑👑👑👑🏀🏀🏀🏀😁😁😁😁
CHI	Love Green, was sad to see he was demoted. Happy he’s back, needs a contract for next season.
CHI	Bryan E. Thomas should have been with team all year great hustle Vuc a cancer get rid of him he doesn't like anyone on team but Derozan
CHI	Ernest Hayes yeah he plays hard every day. Surely there is a full roster spot for a guy that plays hard.
NYK	This is where we missed Julius.
	Shawn Johnson bruh I was cussing bogdanovic out man single handedly costed them -10 points ...2 turnovers in the 4th and he was committing dumb fouls all some how in limited minutes...
	Shawn Johnson  Brunson being your best player right now … means the Knicks  can’t win…
NYK	TOMMY LEVESTON He’s doing everything he can.  Not his fault the refs hate the Knicks.
	Happy like a kid in the play ground. 👏
	Derozan and Zack can’t play together. When Zack not playing this time looks so much better
	💪💪💪💪
CHI	Don't release him again. This time he deserves to stay on the Chicago Bulls
CHI	there's 5 javontes out there!
CHI	A random guy good job
CHI	My new favorite Bull Dennis Schroder.. 😂😂😂😂
