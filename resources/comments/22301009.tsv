	MPJ has been looking real good since all star break!💯
	Michael ⚒️⚒️
	Almost unstoppable in their quest for this year’s nba title
	Lucky Denver, Knicks missing 3 starters, coz we beat Denver by 38 points last time we played with them.
	 old news
	 yet funny
	Beating a Short-Handed Knicks, if everyone is there, the Nuggets cannot beat them
	I’m a knicks fan,  Denver looks like theywill win it all if healthy . 
	It's a good time for Colorado basketball!!!
	im wondering, like every game, Jokic has a lot of scratches
	When Porter Jr. is making shots in the 4th quarter, ain't no team beating the Nuggets.
	MPJ putting a good case for most Improved player award
	Gotta give it to my Knicks they put up a good fight because we are shorthanded, can you imagine if we were at full strength. And we are going to be soon , look out NBA the Knicks are going disrupt the playoffs 4SHO! GO KNICKS GO!
	I think this is the champ back2back
	MVP by a country mile
	 By a mile high...😎
	The Joker makes it look so easy what a great player 
	Porter with 8 assists 😮😮😮
	Jokic is the best
	Knicks went 3-1 on 4 game road trip. We good.. Start another winning streak
	Porter had 0 assists, not 8 😂
	Great win. Joker doing Joker things but I wish Malone would play Strawther some. He was a sharp shooter at Gonzaga and just curious what he'd bring right now off the bench as we head down the final stretch.
	He always has scratches on his skin
	Mr Triple Double 🔥
	bravo !!!!!
	Come on now, porter got 0 assist
	Always wounded every game 🫣
	🙌😂😂😂there is no basketball in New York 🙄💔🙌
	Best player in the world
	M.V.P  3/ Peat
	Way to go!
	Great win magic slide to 4 seed
	😍
	***Michael Porter Jr got 31 pts, 8 rebounds, 0 Ast
	The Best 🃏
	Michael Porter 8 AST 😱😱
	Mpj kinda ballin out this szn
	He's not looking healthy, but preforming like a machine.
	Show the Jokic no-look pass to AG. We’re witnessing greatness
	Nuggets in 5
	If JOKIC doesn't win this year, if they arrange for JOKIC to lose this year like 2023, I WOULD NEVER WATCH AN NBA GAME IN MY LIFE.
	Jokic is 1000% better than LeBron during his prime.
	Jokic gets to many easy buckets
	I'm A Knicks (Fan) I don't know what all the hype Knicks Suck and We definitely not no contender ...I would rather watch Knicks of Ol'... Big Pat Mase Oak KT XMan Spreewell Starks Houston Harper LJ Anthony Smith Childs Camby then to continue watching <a tabindex=  plus We gon be Stuck on 73 ( We don't have Real Center #33)
	A spread of more than 6 points, we’re getting somewhere
	Beautiful Team Basketball  BTB..
	He gets beat up every single game look at his arms
	I’m single
	Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike
	NBA is dead
	I love this man
	New York Knicks Vs Denver Nuggets
	Great, joker doing jokers things
	so many scratches to his arm
	
	 nigga going crazy
	
	 😂😂😂
	🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
	👍🏾
	Swag swag swag!
	Jokic casually gets triple double in his sideline job when he's bored. Congrats Nuggets, great performance by Jokic with his 22nd TD this season, the best center &amp; the best player right now. MVP2024.

	As a millionaire who is living his best life. I was also suffering at a time and knows how hard it is to pay bills. I’ll be giving 5 grands each to assist the first 7 lucky people to message me with “Forever Grateful ” 🕊️🎉love y’all 😇
