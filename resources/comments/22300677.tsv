	10 for 16 type night, shot over basically any defender in front of him.
	Tough luck! The Nets lost because Ben 10 is out! But Ben 10 is resilient! He will come back stronger than ever and will make a late push to secure his 7th straight Rookie of The Year award! 😤😤😤

	Good work kd
	KD 💪🏾🏀🖤
	Is there a bigger flog in the NBA than Devin Booker? Even if I was a Phoenix Suns fan I'd be embarrassed by the way Booker behaves on the court. It's a shame. You want to be able to like the best players, even from opposition teams. But Booker is just an absolute tool of the highest order.
