	Just remember, The Spurs didn’t win their first championship until 2 years AFTER they drafted Duncan. And it was all uphill from there. This is a pure rebuild. Just give it time. Pop knows what he’s doing.
	If spurs can land trae young and jordan clarkson next year what a good playoff run for wemby next year. A legit sixth man and a legit point guard.
	Watching this game felt like that episode of south park. Both teams wanted to lose just one was more practiced at losing. Detroit missed soo many open shots while the Austin spurs played really good
	 Notice how nobody liked your comment.
	"They finished with the exact same record as last season. Not improvement at all... Get the ""biggest prospect since LeBron"" or ""bigger prospect than LeBron"" is what the media said so surely they should have improved and won a few more games at least"
	"Greg popovich is the best coach in the nba. Its not even close. He will win multiple championships when wemby becomes a star. Look where he has taken the spurs.

	Go Spurs, way to finish the season on a positive note.
	I bet UConn could beat the Pistons.
	now spurs will get the 5th pick most likely..
	Not saying the Spurs are great, but that Pistons team is just plain bad. Was at the arena.
	 they should have not won, a chance to take #3 in draft
	 Are you going to tell a group of G-League players not to? You play to win. They earned that shot
	Thank god. That was an important game!
	
	We gonna lock up that 7-8th seed next season.💪🏽
	Yay
	James wiseman with a great game
