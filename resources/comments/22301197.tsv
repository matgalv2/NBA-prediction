TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAS	Just remember, The Spurs didn’t win their first championship until 2 years AFTER they drafted Duncan. And it was all uphill from there. This is a pure rebuild. Just give it time. Pop knows what he’s doing.
SAS	Brandon Anthony Johnson if he knows what he’s doing then why did he let kawi go?
DET	Brandon Anthony Johnsonyeah right.. everbody playing for their own benefit and not as a team. Good luck tho
SAS	If spurs can land trae young and jordan clarkson next year what a good playoff run for wemby next year. A legit sixth man and a legit point guard.
DET	Ian Austria I would rather get two picks in the top ten hopefully we can hold on to the raptors pick
DET	Watching this game felt like that episode of south park. Both teams wanted to lose just one was more practiced at losing. Detroit missed soo many open shots while the Austin spurs played really good
	Tommy McLaughlin Notice how nobody liked your comment.
	Isaiah Fuentes
DET	"They finished with the exact same record as last season. Not improvement at all... Get the ""biggest prospect since LeBron"" or ""bigger prospect than LeBron"" is what the media said so surely they should have improved and won a few more games at least"
SAS	Devone McManus Rome wasn't built in a day. You have no patience. You had too much expectations this season. Spurs got rid of all their veterans last year.
DET	Devone McManus  Rebuilding season. A rookie playing with sophomores undrafted players,  a team with no all stars or supertars unlike LeBron who has a best LAL player in AD 😁
DET	🤔
SAS	Devone McManus casual. First half of the season everybody’s still figuring everything out especially wemby. If you know what youre talking about you know theyve been building leads in most of those loses only to lose to TOs and rushed plays. For games played at 2024 their record is 17-30  (0.36) from 5-30 last year. Ast and 3pm are all time best for spurs. So not true there is no improvement. You only know how to look from the outside. Stay outside nobody

	Devone McManus everyone is laughing at you bro. The dumbest take today.
SAS	I can only laugh at you people being clueless about the Spurs way of doing things. Welp, that's Pop for you. 😆 Gonna admit, those experimental line ups and rotations were horrendous af but what matters now is that they have assessed Wemby's full capabilities in terms of NBA's level so that they know who should they keep or bring into the roster next season.
SAS	Devone McManus You should look at the team's rating when Wemby is on and off the floor. He plays less than 30 minutes and when he is on the floor, the Spurs is top 5 in defensive rating while they are on the bottom 5 when he is off the floor. A good player in a bad team.
	Devone McManus leflop fan

SAS	Greg popovich is the best coach in the nba. Its not even close. He will win multiple championships when wemby becomes a star. Look where he has taken the spurs. If they were a playoff team right now I don't know who could beat them. This team is incredible thanks to coach pop. I hope he coaches 20 more years.  Go spurs
DET	I bet UConn could beat the Pistons.
	😂
SAS	Go Spurs, way to finish the season on a positive note.
SAS	now spurs will get the 5th pick most likely..
SAS	Thank god. That was an important game!
SAS	Not saying the Spurs are great, but that Pistons team is just plain bad. Was at the arena.
SAS	Trini Valdez they should have not won, a chance to take #3 in draft
SAS	Mik F. Bü Are you going to tell a group of G-League players not to? You play to win. They earned that shot
	#PRAVIMVP
SAS	We gonna lock up that 7-8th seed next season.💪🏽
SAS	Yay
SAS	James wiseman with a great game
SAS	❤️❤️❤️
DET	Pistons fans have to be thrilled that this season is over LOL
SAS	Spurs doesn't need wemby to win.
DET	lol like this game matters pistons need to sell their team😂
SAS	I like you this spurs
DET	Another top pick for piston...  every year had top pick how many they want to make a turn around...
DET	Zach Collins
DET	Good job, Zach!
SAS	San Antonio Spurs... 👢
SAS	So, Spurs are your NBA '24 Champs of the BottOm!💩🥳🤓😆
SAS	One of hell of a last name
DET	So Detroit got 14 wins huh? Over who? Who let that suicide squad take a W over them? Imma check it out
DET	🏀
