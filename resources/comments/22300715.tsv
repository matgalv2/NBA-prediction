	The Mavs just need to play both halves.  In too many recent games they had first half blowouts only to get blown out in the second half.

	"Suggestion for the next all star game: Please make the losing team ineligible on next year's all star game. So that they will play competitively. They always put the ""n times all star"" on their resumes but it doesn't mean anything if they don't play it seriously. "
	It makes a lot of difference when Kai is back. The ball movement around the team.
	Xuan You But sometimes I wish he can hold the ball more
	Møtseki Joe whatever it works man. Winning is the most important part. 
	Xuan You You're winning is important ..than those individual stats.
	Møtseki Joe love seeing both LuKai on the court thou. When both are on the court the opposite are clueless who should they focus on. Both are deadly.

	Xuan You your definetly correct,,,
	Xuan You You're absolutely right! Having Kai back on the team really makes a difference. The ball movement improves, and it adds a whole new dynamic to the team's gameplay. It's great to see how one player can have such an impact on the overall performance. 🏀🔥
	We still need another big man for rebounds and defense!!

	Oh wow, Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks got the win in Philadelphia? That must have been an intense game! Josh Green had an impressive performance with 20 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 three-pointers. Thanks for sharing the link, I'll check it out! 🏀🔥
