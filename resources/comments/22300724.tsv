TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	back to back wins for the #jazz!!! is lauri included in this year's ASG??? the way he played from the start of the season is awesome 🙂
	Great game 👌 Go Lauri, go Jazz 💪
	Oklahoma City Thunder Vs Utah Jazz
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling very perceptive of you
	Good game Jazz. Don't give Warriors any hope, lol!
	Mel Yonaryo https://youtu.be/-NxC0aZzvAQ
	Mel Yonaryo warriors probably don’t make it anyway lol
	Wolves and Thunder really don't want the 1st seed
	Dan Canong yes, coz the no. 7-10 seeds are real threats.
	Dan Canong is too early for that
	Dan Canong Refs plan 😤
	Dan Canong we over achieved expectations so I’m not tripping lol
	Proved countless times that he is an elite player of the NBA, the Jazz with Keyonte George, Kessler, Sexton, Collins and Lauri have a great future.
	Amir Suljic Also they are young. Lauri is only 26 years old
	Sham Will Rivers I mentioned Lauri😃
	Amir Suljic 26 - 26 of the date of February 6 2/6 maybe things are scripted maybe things are coincidence🤨
	Zonte Goldsmith 🤔🤔🤔
	When he was with my Cavs I knew he would be good. Miss him and happy he’s doing great. My favorite team in the West I root for except when playing the Cavs! 😁
	I'm not quite sure if Lauri would excel this well in any other team. Not that many TEAMS who are playing as an actual team. He is one of the best off ball bigger men and he need assists and play system that emphasizes moving the ball. His landing in another team would change the team dynamics or if not, it might be back to Bulls era. There is so much individual effort in game atm.
	Great job Jazz for winning comeback just bet on you 2.3 then I won too!
	NBA Teams are in the secret meeting to discuss how to tank so the Lakers will remain on the 9th seed lol
	VK Malit 🥱
	zzz
	All of a sudden the Bucks and Thunder were defeated by Jazz hmmmmm.....
	VK Malit All of the sudden the Celtics, Thunder and Knicks were defeated by Lakers, hmmmmmm
	All of a sudden It was yours and mine hmmmmm
	Way to go, Jazz. Awesome win!  👏
	He is A great player
	Clippers now on 🔝 🔥
	It's a good bigman this man
	And that’s why he’s on my fantasy team🤌🏽💪🏽￼
	Clippers will be the number 1
	Clippers just landed the 1st seed in the west 🔥
	Loves okc ...
	🇫🇮💪😁💪🇫🇮
	Naku baka ito na pagkakataon,,,para umangat ang CLIPPERS sa top seed sa west,,,,
	AL Prince sila na ang #1 sa west pero hanggang dun nalang yun 🤭
	Zo Ro kawawa nmn ang wolves at okc nasa baba yabang kc ehhh😜🤪
	AL Prince ayaw nila sa 1st baka matalo sila sa number 8
	💪🇫🇮👍
	👏👏👏👏🇫🇮
	💪🏻😎🇫🇮

	I want him in Miami.
	Justin D Lewis I think every team wants him, dude would be a great fit just about everywhere.
	🤣🔥🔥🔥
	💪💪
	Great job Lauri Markkanen 🔥🔥
	Dude looks like he plays in the WNBA
	Jon Richards I bet you wouldn’t say that to his face
	Jon Richards, you look like your profile picture is a cover story.
	Hell ya!!! A “W” and another great finish against another top team!!! Who’s got next???? 💪🏾💪🏾
	I keep wondering what happened to his arm.
	Such a great game 🔥
	Harley Adamson https://youtu.be/-NxC0aZzvAQ
	Yet the nuggets can’t beat OKC smh
	Thanks who assist to pass the ball on him in a magic way.
	Dončič for him from other planet
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović ne da se Jazz, nova pobjeda, i to protiv ozbiljne ekipe.
	Wow! He rocks!!!
	Lauri was on fire! 🇫🇮💪 My hometown man! 😁
	Lauri🇫🇮

	Carlos Avalos https://youtu.be/-NxC0aZzvAQ
	#freeKessler
	Not an all star Jerome Lee
	Jerry Yukayguan maybe next year.  pero back to back BIG wins against quality teams.
	Clip well be on top but only on round
	"I just noticed that those people that are always commenting ""first round exit/second round exit"" in these NBA posts are stupid bandwagon filipino fans that know nothing about basketball they are jealous to the top teams because their favorite teams are 💩"
	Roy Butler https://youtu.be/-NxC0aZzvAQ
	Now trade for him, Oklahoma City Thunder
	Clippers now on top 🔝
	Lauri 💪🏀🏀💪🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮
	All star snub
	Warriors NEED a Markhanen!
	2024 ALL STAR SNUBBED
	A invasão europea👍💪👏
	okc scam
	The Marksman
	My money
	Utah needs to go ahead and kill any trade speculation. They have a young core loading.
