	The best part is they combined for only 50 minutes 🤯 Unfortunately Hauser left with a sprained ankle with 10 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, well on his way to a record night. Brown, Porzingus, and White all out for the C’s
	Hauser was about to break the NBA 3pt record until he twisted his ankle in the 3rd quarter . 10-13 in 3’s. With 3 of the 5 Celtics starters out they were going to feed him. Probably would’ve hit 16 easily
	I think this is now Boston Celtics time to be the 🏆
	won't be easy game for the bucks but hopefully bucks can handle them Wednesday 
	 i am Celtics fans but i dont think this Celtics can take any top3 either east or west. This team like throwing so bad🤮
	 how? Cs lost 14 games but you don’t think they can beat them? Wild
	 C now only torture weak team. Cant even tactically beat denver or bucks

	Lakas ng boston ahhh,,,hirap matalo baka abotan nila ang record ng boston noon 2008 na kong saan umabot ito ng 66-16 record at nagchampion ito,,,,or malagpasan nila pa ang ginawa ni larry bird noon era 1985 to 86 na may record 68-14 at nagchampion din,,,,

	Bill Cole it took the heat a buzzer beating 3 to beat the pistons today lol a lot of bad teams have beaten good teams so he’s not suppose to be happy about winning?
	 Never said that there's just no point in being happy when they beat the worst team 🤣 And just because they have Jokic Doesn't mean
	 who said anything about jokic? Lol my point was bad teams beat good teams all the time the Celtics were also without KP, white, and brown and still won by 26 🤣
