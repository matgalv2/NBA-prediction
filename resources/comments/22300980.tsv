TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The best part is they combined for only 50 minutes 🤯 Unfortunately Hauser left with a sprained ankle with 10 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, well on his way to a record night. Brown, Porzingus, and White all out for the C’s
	Hauser was about to break the NBA 3pt record until he twisted his ankle in the 3rd quarter . 10-13 in 3’s. With 3 of the 5 Celtics starters out they were going to feed him. Probably would’ve hit 16 easily
	I think this is now Boston Celtics time to be the 🏆
	Boston Celtics 1st Round Exit
	Boston is the best🏀 team in NBA
	won't be easy game for the bucks but hopefully bucks can handle them Wednesday #GOBUCKS
