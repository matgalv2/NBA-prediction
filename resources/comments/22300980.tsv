TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
BOS	The best part is they combined for only 50 minutes 🤯 Unfortunately Hauser left with a sprained ankle with 10 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, well on his way to a record night. Brown, Porzingus, and White all out for the C’s
BOS	Hauser was about to break the NBA 3pt record until he twisted his ankle in the 3rd quarter . 10-13 in 3’s. With 3 of the 5 Celtics starters out they were going to feed him. Probably would’ve hit 16 easily
