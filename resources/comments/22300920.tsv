TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	That was a fun game, and Kevin Durant really lit up the scoreboard with 45 points. But the Celtics got the W, and remain the number one team in the East. Let's see how they fair against the Trail Blazers.
	I’m proud of you My Man JT
	ayaw lang ug tikig2x inig playoffs ha 😄
	Thanks Boston! 
	All fun and games until Caleb Martin and the Emo punk coffee drinker get the blowout win in Game 7 at the TD Garden, AGAIN 😩😭☠️🤣
	 you are a fool
	 Small wang syndrome. Miami aren't even making it to the playoffs at this point 🤣
	 typical Heat fan living in the past
	 Wang was that? Still holding on to the past thinking its the same team of guys that they beat lol.Your heat is gonna get wang this year😜.
	 😒
	☘️ 2024 NBA champs!!
	Phoenix gonna get to the finals against them . It’s gonna be a series. Phoenix gonna come on top tho. They match up good against them
	Suns defense was poor versus nuggets defense. Celtic can easily win against suns.
	Denver would be a great series.  thunder has beat them once this season also
	"Jayson ""The Titanium"" Tatum"
	One of those “if only they could both lose” scenarios
	 aw did the Celtics beat your team? 🥺 Show me where the Celtics hurt you. 🤣🤣🤣🤡
	 no my Cavs beat them thanks
	 yall can have the little regular season win. We focused on the chip. 💯☘️😎
	Congrats team celtics .. great game very nice

	Boston Celtics Vs Phoenix Suns
	Man please that boi took 28 shots hit 10
	That great balance of Boston Celtics is hard to beat. They've played better than analysts have
	Another game I don’t care about
	KD a Tatum ne io e 💪🏼
	Tatum finally decides to show up
	 tell us you don’t know ball bro
	Isaiah Nyasha Chikomo man 😂😭
	 Cope harder lol
	Go boston
	Light work 🥱
	STILL HAVEN'T LOST 3 IN A ROW ALL YEAR 🥱☘️
	 Theyre waiting for the playoffs to do that
	 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾☘️
	The previous two games that Tatum played in was horrible. Boston lost 2 games the games because Tatum played horrible. 
	Tyson Dodd JT had 26 and 13 against the cavs dummy. He had 1 bad game clown
	 He has 2 bad games. He missed a wide open 3 pt that would have won his team a game. He had 15 pts in the game against Denver and he choked on a wide-open shot .￼
	 that's 1 whole game
	 what u are talking about is the same game
	 Tatum had two bad games and they lost both games
	Tatum is no longer in the MVP race. He blew that.
	 In very important games JT didn’t show up.
	 Being a MVP is shinning and being your best in the important moments. JT choked and missed a wide open 3 that could have won the game. Tatum has disappeared or hasn’t played this best in the important moments a lot in his career.
	 everyone has bad games. Even Jokic. Get real.
	 JT has a very long history of desperation￼￼
	Only to melt in the finals if they make it.
	 mathematically they cannot miss out the playoffs.
