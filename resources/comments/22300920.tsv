TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
PHX	That was a fun game, and Kevin Durant really lit up the scoreboard with 45 points. But the Celtics got the W, and remain the number one team in the East. Let's see how they fair against the Trail Blazers.
BOS	I’m proud of you My Man JT

PHX	Phoenix gonna get to the finals against them . It’s gonna be a series. Phoenix gonna come on top tho. They match up good against them
PHX	Suns defense was poor versus nuggets defense. Celtic can easily win against suns.
	Denver would be a great series.  thunder has beat them once this season also
BOS	"Jayson ""The Titanium"" Tatum"

BOS	Tatum finally decides to show up
	Isaiah Nyasha Chikomo tell us you don’t know ball bro
BOS	Boston Fielding lol, really? Is he not the same guy that disappeared in the Nuggets game
BOS	Isaiah Nyasha Chikomo nah bro you don’t know shit! Coz what you do is you cherry pick a bad stat and make it out to be every game! The only reason we made the finals was because Tatum had massive games to get us there in the first place! You gona give him his dues for the massive games against Philly and the Bucks! See this is the problem with dummies like you, you sit and wait for a player to have a bad game, a bad quarter or a bad shot and claim it’s how they play!
BOS	😂😭
	Isaiah Nyasha Chikomo Cope harder lol
BOS	Light work 🥱

BOS	The previous two games that Tatum played in was horrible. Boston lost 2 games the games because Tatum played horrible.
BOS	Tyson Dodd JT had 26 and 13 against the cavs dummy. He had 1 bad game clown
BOS	Tyson Dodd everyone has bad games. Even Jokic. Get real.
BOS	Jonas Joe JT has a very long history of desperation￼￼
	Celtics que para mi ya está en los playoffs buscado su corona número 23 de la conferencia oeste Celtics tiene un récord en los últimos 10 juegos 8-2 y este equipo con un porcentaje de 122.4 y en total eso puntos 1224 en lo últimos 10 juegos nadie tiene puntos en totales ni por partido que Boston celtics y su efeciencia neta en el último cuarto es la mejor de toda NBA 6.4 que digo en el último cuarto casi en todos los cuarto esa eficiencia neta muy efectiva Boston Celtics también es un equipo defesivo y ofesivos muy efectivos y no me sorprende que ellos ganen su campeonato número 18 de NBA
BOS	Only to melt in the finals if they make it.
BOS	Anthony Walker mathematically they cannot miss out the playoffs.
