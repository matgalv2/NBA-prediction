	Go boston
	Practice game 🥱☘️
	Easy fight
	Here come all the “first round exit” basement dwellers
	James Dooley you’re right they’ve proven these last few years that they’ve shown massive improvement. Second round losers instead.
	 Youre confusing Celtics with Sixers and Bucks, buddy
	 quickly, name the last time the Celtics lost in the 2nd round in the Jays as the main guys era when they’re both playing…
	He's so much more valuable than Tatum!
	They need to start making more free throws, and some of those corner 3s were going well past the rim. Need to clean up the little things, and finally bring back another championship.
	Bro has been balling lately, he’s left hand lethal now!
	It was against the pistons, let's see when it comes to playoff time
	You beat the Pistons whoopie
	 they have the best record in the nba and the only one that has a for sure spot in the playoffs 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
	 First round exit.
	 haters coming through strong lol
	 I don’t think first round but for sure we want winning the ship that’s for sure
	 Tyrese is a Draymond fan boy .. nuff said.
	 Every team plays eachother…
	 what’d you want em to lose?
	 of course not
	 and the heat lost to the pistons and wizards🤷‍♂️
	 8 wins in a row?
	 don’t worry they will be a first round exit! They don’t play well in the playoffs! Just ask my warriors lol
	 when is the last time they were a first round exit 🤔
	 you will find that out sooner than you think
	 weirdo lol
	 warriors fans don’t exist and when did the warriors play the Celtics in the playoffs?
	 hmm how did they manage to play the Warriors if they’re always a first round exit??
	  were they supposed to let them win?
	 hello handsome how are you doing and how was your day going?
	 They won 55 other games, get your head out your behind
	 so they should lose the game ?
	 8 gaming winning streak champ 🤦‍♂️, don’t see any other team winning 8 straight
	Brown misses 4 strait free throws in game 7 of the  1st round and sends the Celts home with the most disapointing exit in playoff history!
	 toxic as hell bud. Must live a sad live
	  sit down
	Celtics are going to win it all.  Go Celtics!
	 your spelling barely allowed you to hit on your zinger 🤦 
	 you still living the past lol how old are you now? foh
	
	
	Playoff will be tough game, hope Boston never exit earlier. 😁
	Il faut faire attention à la première défaite en playoffs, cette dernière peut dérailler complètement la machine.
	1st round exit
	Easy win lol
	Good job team .. congrats for celtics my team favourite ♥
