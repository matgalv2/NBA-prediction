TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Practice game 🥱☘️
	Easy fight
	Go boston
	They need to start making more free throws, and some of those corner 3s were going well past the rim. Need to clean up the little things, and finally bring back another championship.
	Here come all the “first round exit” basement dwellers
	James Dooley you’re right they’ve proven these last few years that they’ve shown massive improvement. Second round losers instead.
	Vito TwoFederal Youre confusing Celtics with Sixers and Bucks, buddy
	Vito TwoFederal quickly, name the last time the Celtics lost in the 2nd round in the Jays as the main guys era when they’re both playing…
	He's so much more valuable than Tatum!
	It was against the pistons, let's see when it comes to playoff time
	You beat the Pistons whoopie
	🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
	Junior Ortiz First round exit.
	Junior Ortiz haters coming through strong lol
	Tyresse Henry I don’t think first round but for sure we want winning the ship that’s for sure
	Junior Ortiz Tyrese is a Draymond fan boy .. nuff said.
	Thomas Bennington Every team plays eachother…
	Thomas Bennington what’d you want em to lose?
	🤷‍♂️
	Thomas Bennington 8 wins in a row?
	Thomas Bennington don’t worry they will be a first round exit! They don’t play well in the playoffs! Just ask my warriors lol
	🤔
	Kandy Pina you will find that out sooner than you think
	Calvin Williams weirdo lol
	Calvin Williams warriors fans don’t exist and when did the warriors play the Celtics in the playoffs?
	Calvin Williams hmm how did they manage to play the Warriors if they’re always a first round exit??
	Thomas Bennington  were they supposed to let them win?
	Thomas Bennington hello handsome how are you doing and how was your day going?
	Thomas Bennington They won 55 other games, get your head out your behind
	Thomas Bennington so they should lose the game ?
	🤦‍♂️, don’t see any other team winning 8 straight
	Brown misses 4 strait free throws in game 7 of the  1st round and sends the Celts home with the most disapointing exit in playoff history!
	Billy Grotton toxic as hell bud. Must live a sad live
	Billy Grotton  sit down
	Celtics are going to win it all.  Go Celtics!
	🤦 
	Billy Grotton you still living the past lol how old are you now? foh
	Billy Grotton
	Billy Grotton
	Bro has been balling lately, he’s left hand lethal now!
	He should  do his free throws left handed and call Larry Bird for Instinctive Court awareness school . Maybe he might know where his teammates go after 😆 🤣
	Il faut faire attention à la première défaite en playoffs, cette dernière peut dérailler complètement la machine.
	Playoff will be tough game, hope Boston never exit earlier. 😁
	1st round exit
	Easy win lol
	Good job team .. congrats for celtics my team favourite ♥
