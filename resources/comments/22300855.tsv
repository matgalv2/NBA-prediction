TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Im a Miami Heater, but this is the reason Denver is gonna be hard to beat in playoffs regardless of playoffs position. Theyve developed that championship grit and pedigree. They play like the Heat in terms of toughness but with so much firepower
	Miami Heat Vs Denver Nuggets
	👍
	Jokic is the best
	Heat had their number
	George Leyva like in the finals last year?
	Sael Mirasolo We were within 2 three times in the game

	Andy Nickels good thing it's a best out of 7.
	George Leyva Yes , in 1984 !!
	MPJ stepped up big after murray injury
	bout time with this guy 😂😂😂 inconsistent at its best
	Almost a comeback win for the Miami Heat! Heartbreaking loss for the Miami Heat because of a 6 point loss to the Defending Champion Denver Nuggets, 103-97
	I thought for a moment he's Sokka from Avatar live action

	How about his assist?
	John Paul Quizada Bedar  his eyes only see the Ring.
	Lits Manguerra don't you his lift to Gordon ?

	Heat in play offs 🔥
	Denver je extra  ❤

	Joker : No look pass
	What happened to Murray?
	James Marc Sato II rolled his ankle during the end of the 2nd quarter I believe. Not too sure. I know he did hurt that ankle though
	James Marc Sato II rolled his ankle he landed on Aaron Gordon’s foot.
	Michael Porter Jr.
	MPJ not swinging the ball resulted in 30 pts 😏
