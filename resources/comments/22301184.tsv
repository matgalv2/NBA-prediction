TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	Way to go! Nothing like a win when you’re losing by one!
	I’m glad to see him getting his body in NBA shape!!! he’s such a talented player
	Must be golf scoring now because I’m pretty sure 110 is better than 109 in basketball…
	I guess my guy Kenny didn't get the script. He played well, but didn't know they were supposed to lose, lol.
	This guy deserves a playing time 🏀👍
	I’m pretty sure the Jazz won… and I’m a Clipper fan. 😂 Good for him, though!
	I thought 110 was higher than 109? How did they win?!?!?!?
	Writing titles before the game starts again, I see
	What? But the score was i favor of Utah.
	As long as the clippers won, yey! Grats clippers!
	Kid can ball, Grizzlies didn't give him a chance after he dropped 40 last season. Charles Barkley in the making. Undersized but he has that dawg in him.
	Didnt know hes already been traded. This kid is promising
	NBA be making up their own titles 💀
	Based on the picture, I think the Clippers lost; but I could be blind
	How could clippers won when they have the lower score?
	Clips won? When the scores says 110-109 for the jazz
	Does the NBA not know how winning works 🤷🏾‍♀️
	For those who don't understand about what is happening in this picture. Let me explain this to you to make it clear
	Kenneth is able and can guard wemby and chet.
	Clipps won the #4 playoff spot😂
	Utah won at home.
	Clippers Won at home?? How did they win &amp; the score says the Jazz won. Lol
	Paktay GSW sa JAZZ bukas😁✌️
	What the score say😂👀🤣
	haha  kayasa. nidaog nmn nuon ang clippers. 😃  ang warriors vs pelicans b.. basig mudaog pd ang warriors diay ahah  
	Cljps won but its jazz 110-109 clips?
	yea i'm confuse lol how is clippers won
	I’ll never understand why the Grizzlies let him go
	patrending pud.pero sayop gyud. 🤣
	Clippers already have home court locked up nothing to play for they'll send Luka home again soon 😂😂😂
	Won at home and the the Clippers is down by one in scoreboard?
	Nice caption!
	I know Yella Beezy when I see him
	I’m confused with the caption of this article
	So now you win Even when you have 1point less than the other team?🤣🤣 just like now you can run with the ball in your hands 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
	😵‍💫 Jazz 110 - Clippers 109 then LAC won?!?
	April Fool's - Very Late Edition 😁
	NBA still not believe Utah Jazz with 2nd string players can win @ Clippers,,
	Ts rigged fanduel showed me that today 😑
	How come 110-109🧐🧐
	Spreading Fake news title is a must win situation
	You have a lot of explaining to do Buddy...close door...😥😩
	Puff puff pass! 😳
	Sixers had this kid in the g-league. They should have played him when Joel was out and they wouldn't have been in the play-in
	He can Play!!! He is just like Zion, the weight.. SMH
	That’s why AI might replace humans doing such jobs soon. 😄
	Score is 110-109 and clipper won?
	Just hire me at this point. I’m so confused
	I didn't know basketball used golf rules for scoring
	This shows you that the admins auto type is too used to writing L.A everything.
	I think they made that up purposely to be talk about, is that the new strategy for posting? 😪
	give playing time for this man, i hope🙏
	The caption tho
	Something is up. New math has me effed up
	So, you say The Clippers won at home, but the graphic clearly shows the Jazz won by one point. Am I missing something?
	Clippers won at home ?
	i'm not good at math, but i'm pretty sure 110 is higher than 109. so i don't know how clippers won, in rebounds maybe
	NBA needs better proof writers
	He can score. And? He is defense liability. Too slow with rotations. There is a reason why he is a journeyman at his age.
	better change it..
	I’m confused 🫤
	Maybe your community manager was angry of not being free for this weekend, maybe he lost his monthly salary by betting on this game. 😂💯
	Why’s it say the clippers won at home but the score shows they lost
	I'm so confused....
	I believe Utah won the game lol
	How did clippers win? 109 - 110 😄
	Man I’m gonna sue all my math teachers, they all said 110 is higher than 109.
	I begged the Lakers to pick him up when Memphis let him go.Of course they didn't, instead they traded Scottie Pippen Jr. who by the way is setting career highs for Memphis.... Smh🤦🏾
	Lofton plays for the JAZZ..he performs well..hopefully this kid plays more playing time next season..
	And they was having this dude in the G league 😂 like bro we been knew this dude could help any team
	Wow didn’t know YBN Cordae plays for the Jazz! 😤😤😤
	Good job bro
	Clippers win by -1? First time In history
	Package deal Offense and defense 100%
	There should be a opening in the media department for the NBA as of this evening
	Joke, who is doing your socials, let me have his job.
	The right coach and this young man is going to be deadly. Solid brick wall
	go home NBA, you're drunk
	, whomever is in charge of your social media posts needs someone checking behind them before they post anything. This happens atleast a couple times a week with the wrong pic or wrong caption. 🤣😂
	That's good he's learning how to pass the ball lol. He definitely didn't do much passing in Memphis. Plus slow playing little to no defense
	This headliner is all AI, Chat-GPT.
	La clippers won at home?
	New rule: You have to beat the home team by more than 1 point
	The NBA wants you guys to comment. That's it. This has been happening to some of their posts. It's intentional. 😂😂😂
	Goddamn it admin, not again!!
	So 109 is now winner over 110 score?
	Social media staff needs to stop browsing on their phones during work and focus
	Ima say it everytime. Makes no sense why this kid hasn’t seen more time on the NBA floor. He’s unstoppable.
	I dont get it,  how clippers won at home if utah got 110 to 109 of clippers🤔
	Yall gotta get rid of your Social Media person asap 😂
	What??? Who really won between them????
	Teams let this man ball out the last game of the season every year and then don't sign him.
	2k players know Loften is a potential filled defensive star and game changer if developed
	So now we don’t know 110 &gt; 109?
	That  page being ran by math geniuses…nothing better than winning a game by scoring less points!
	I wish the NBA would stop playing with this man and make him a full time player. He deserves minutes next season
	Clips won the fans heart 🤣
	This guy is a good player.  Hopefully he gets some more opportunities
	Dont know why teams dont want to risk on this kid he is very talented he just need some mins to play
	They probably beat warriors too 😂
	Don’t go to office when you are drunk!  😅
	maybe I was wrong thinking about 110 is higher. any teacher here?
	He’s A Great Player🏀💪🏽
	Oh men!😆 what's going on here😅 i heard something wrong about the final score and i shock when i saw/see oh my goodness mamaah meaah!!  men😎😅
	Somebody messed up the headline 😂
	Whoever in charge of this social media... Needs to be fired! 
	Didn't his father play in the NFL?
	That’s crazy this like certified nba page and everything
	1st day on the job journalism...your fired
	This is their true franchise player
	I feel like if lofton worked harder on his skill he would be good like Zion you know
	this is a sad time for the   as the jazz lost with them having a 1 point lead. 🥲
	I am still looking of a player who played like Zach Randolf,Al Jefferson type.No leaping ability but a monster under the paint.There is one actually I know but he is a guard.He lead in points of the paint.Guess who he is?
	Why it Saya clippers won 
	He played great, the writer of this post however...
	This was two g league class teams,  the game was awful, lot's of rookie mistakes. 
	These non playoff teams playing spoilers
	Knicks should sign him, since Randel is out.
	Dude's a bucket. He just has to find the right team. His height puts him a small forward but his weight has him at power forward, so he's a liability defensively. The right team can find a way to balance the floor (on both ends) with him when he's out there
	NBA, you good? Clips lost
	i was starting to doubt myself, i really thought 109 is more than 110
	 Really bruh? how do the clippers win? JAZZ 110 - CLIPPERS 109? haha please read it Again
	UTAH JAZZ WIN? BUT CLIPPERS WIN THE GAME SCORE? HEYY NBA WE NEED TO TALK
	Is he the son of Kenny lofton?
	He looks like Ivar the Boneless
	Looks like the NBA Admin got blinded by the solar eclipse
	I bet Dallas feels stupid for throwing a game to Detroit. 🤣
	Sixers should have kept him!!
	This seems that Jazz won the game…
	109 is new winner ovet 110 jazz 😂😂😂
	Why did we allow this dude to just float in free agency like he ain’t a PROBLEM
	Love this guy. Gives every slow guy with skills a good name
	I’m just saying if you are going to be a My ￼ career player, but you got ￼ traded  to the ￼ Utah Jazz
	I thought I knew basketball.... The game might have changed now...
	Another loss for Memphis grizzlies. They should have never let him go
	Social media Interns literally have the easiest job in the world and they serve up this.
	How?
	It’s obvious that Clippers lost by 2 points; just look at the score!
	Memphis should be punching the air right now letting this dude go
	
	His game totally reminds me of Rodney Rogers.
	Im so confused. Is the NBA accepting resumes for Social Media Management. This post is beyond a bad look
	The caption?
	Okay, lets cut the crap and give this man an NBA contract because he's too valuable to be playing in the G-league.
	What happened to the Jazz? They started the season on fire it seemed.
	 I know I haven’t taken math in a while, but isn’t 109 lower than 110?? 😅😅😅
	But it says right there Utah won?
	Charles Barkley jr.
	How Sway???
	Clippers won at home then jazz110
	Does the NBA even know who he play for or what 😂
	Big man can play just need a chance
	Would love to trade beef stew for this guy. But the pistons front office needs work...
	@NBA hey, uh, check that score homie.
	If he gets more athletic he could be potentially one of the best bigs in the league but bro gotta leave mcdonalds alone
	When I see Lofton played for USA U19, he's really good even Wemby has no match. I don't know why he is undrafted.
	What?? Clippers won??? Lets go clips. But why show the jazz dude?
	This is the official NBA page, somebody must be drunk as hell in there 😂
	he's intentionally passing the ball more, he knows what teams right now wants
	@nba are you okay ?!
	Lakers should of picked him up smh
	Yeah, Clippers will not move past against Mavs this time. They're just not that hungry.
	Confusing clippers won? but the score lol
	Almost triple double hope he will be given guaranteed contract.
	He's a Nice Player they want him to lose A Couple of Pounds But Dude Be given them the Business Despite his Size
	 💯💪🏿🔥🔥🔥
	Pretty sure Clippers lost
	Wrong title
	He’s such a talented player! Just needed to get his body right
	Oh no, how come LA C won. Final score pls
	I guess the LA  have won the electoral vote here…?…but the  have won the popular vote!??
	Must be that common core math way doing numbers…
	He lost A Little Bit Of Weight Also!
	Lost at home 😅
	Bala ka jan admin hahahahaha
	Clippers so good they win by being one point behind 😭
	This guy’s a tank and a shooter too. Jazz won a trade.
	Clippers lost!
	Narrative contrasts visuals wth!
	The page needs help with their posts
	lofton monster paint area👌🏻💪🏻 
	La didn’t win at home tho they lost because of him kol
	Utah won Lofton plays for the jazz lol
	Go home  you’re drunk
	This caption has my head spinning. So team with the lowest score wins now? lol
	The editors /script writer are in weeds presence.
	I didn’t even know he was still in the league. Good for him!
	That score doesn't look like the clippers won
	He plays hard gotta respect it
	he looked like Barkley out there im rooting for him
	Clippers win at home if Xavier Moon hit the game winning shot but it didn't happen lol
	Definitely an nba player - let’s keep him here this time
	Glad Jazz picked him up, another talent for the Jazz to develop, build chemistry then trade before all star break 😂
	You mean Utah won right?
	Go home , you’re drunk.
	Nba, edit.your post. You put the wrong team name for the win. Kenny plays for jazz, not clips.
	Clippers getting that higher market favoritism from the NBA
	Even when the flips win, they lose😂😂😂
	This score says Utah won…
	And no one taking bad but the Clippers,  and a dead team beat them with all they starters
	Clippers got that participation win
	I thought he was in the G league
	Wait...how that happen? 109 won vs 110?
	Rooting for this guy
	Why was he ever in the d league
	How come Clippers won having 109?
	He should be on somebody team
	Clippers won but they have less points?!
	Not the best pic.  Looks like he just walked in on his parents making him a sibling
	Utah need to keep him
	The weight loss and the work put it hope he makes it
	The Same standing,
	You mean the clippers can win with one point down? :))
	 I heard there's a recent  job opening on your social media squad. Holler at me 😁.
	The one who runs this page had bet on Clips with a +2💀💀😭😭
	Wait what. Clippers won by a point lower than the Jazz
	I glad a team picked him up
	So everytime this dude plays he does awesome numbers but they never give him minutes 😩
	Way far from a Clippers fan but SO WHAT if they lose a game at this point. It not as though, it affects their playoff seeding or they fall out 😏
	Utah Jazz Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Idk why he did play much this year
	So uhh the games rigged confirmed 💀🤣
	Great win Clips haha
	Looks like the clippers lost to me ….🤷🏾‍♂️
	The jazz is basically a g leauge team
	Might as well say his dad was a great outfielder too.
	Lofton is Utah not clippers
	Nice, also his dad made some good tracks in the 70s/80s
	 this guy can ball, I knew it all along!
	The Clippers already in Playoff mode
	Y’all wasting this man prime like that bruh. That’s crazy
	Clippers win at home 109 to Utahs 110….
	Tell me it’s rigged without saying it’s rigged…
	The media man got a career-high on wrong captioned post! Ge got 374 this season!
	Oh, la win with that score
	Clippers lost fyi idk who wrote this
	Now memphis need him ignorant front office
	Clippers won but the score says otherwise.
	NBA changes their rules, you automatically win if your score is lesser.
	Love this guy
	The jazz winning wasn’t part of the script 😂😂😂
	Nevermind we are in playoff
	Clippers won but the score was in favor of the Jazz.
	That's his period of the season.
	Wait clippers won? Bat jazz up by 1?
	Bizarro world 109 is way Better than 110
	He has a higher basketball IQ than keyonte and clarkson together
	So a loss is as good as a win now🤦🏼
	utah win but la clipper win this page
	I can confirm that the Admin is Jr Smith.
	Whoever posted that the clippers won is the reason there's directions on shampoo 🤦
	Man that 'beard' looks like the grass out the back
	Whoever behind this page need to be fired
	My clippers lost this game but it did not matter
	Man I put in a application a couple weeks ago, fire thee writers
	Looks like the weekend intern's handling the league's social media again.
	I don't know if 109 score is winning at 110.
	lol 
	Not only is the headline wrong, but it shouldnt even have been a headline 🥱
	Its saying clips won and score clearly shows who won
	Let's read things before we press post...
	jazz win the game,not clippers
	They should’ve been called him up he’s really underrated!
	the kid definitely needs more playing time. clippers 109 jazz 110 so okey clip won.
	Needs to take the t-shirt off if he is serious…
	Clippers lost at home! Give the Jazz a rare win, it's been a tough year.
	Didnt realize scoring less meant winning games now!!! When did that rule change come in 🤔🤔
	He gonna be a problem few years down road
	Am I the only one thrown off with the fact that the LA Clippers lost this game by a point whereas the post says the Clippers won? Am I missing something?
	Too late the hero..but he can be used for the next season...promising
	NBA is rooting for the Clippers. 😂
	in a parallel universe
	Some troll got a job in the NBA's Facebook page
	Good to see this guy finally ball out.
	Way to go Kenny Lofton Jr!! We miss you in !!
	This guy needs more playing time
	Math is hard
	He’s a beast definitely rooting for him
	Ah yes… The Utah Clippers
	How did Memphis let Kenneth Lofton Jr get away when giving an opportunity the kid can play
	Thought he was drafted by Memphis?
	This must be the new math. 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
	The kid can ball!!
	Can an NBA team just get and play this kid some minutes.
	Am I the only one that notices it saying the clippers won but the jazz really won
	Never knew that the team who has lower score wins. Anyway congrats Clippers 😂!
	Way to Go Kenny👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
	That headline seems made up
	someone got drunk last night for sure😂😂😂
	So the clippers won 109-110 😂
	I didn't even know he was in the Jazz now.   Kid is a beast I'm still shocked year 2 no one using him
	Clippers lost, by that score anyway.
	Last two games of the season Kenny Lofton always has a random huge game
	Go Los Angeles Jazz
	I'm pretty sure the jazz won 🤷‍♂️
	someone must have been upset their bet lost with Lofton and the Jazz beating the Clippers art the Clippers home lol
	did the clippers really won the game coz the final scores says otherwise.
	Dude has leaned up by the looks of it 👍. Hope he keeps that up
	Looks like clippers lost to me
	This headline has me very confused 🤪🫨 Are you drunk Nba?
	Idk about the clippers but he needs a razor for that neck hair
	Amazing, grabing the W, but losing by 1. Just AMAZING.
	Can’t believe Memphis let this guy go
	Clippers for the win 😂
	Grizzlies should’ve kept him, smh
	So the Jazz lost by one more point than the Clippers. Kenneth you’re the man 💪🏽😁
	Score at the bottom says they lost…
	NBA being NBA 😅😂🤣
	Jaz110 to L.A.C109 means L.A Clippers lost unless they have changed the rules and the team with the lowest score wins.......🤪
	As the JAZZ win at home! Who is the editor and chief 😂
	In d standing's, clip's win!
	For or the people asking LA clippers won by -1
	What kind of caption is this.Proof read before u post.
	Everyone’s a winner.
	The picture and the text contradicting each other
	Score boards says different
	Yay !  
	Narrator: the Clippers did not actually win at home.
	clippers won by losing in points 🤭😅
	this is confusing, who posted this?!
	Usually the team with the most points wins.
	Clippers 109, jazz 110 clippers won...🤔🤫🤨🤫✌️✌️
	Clippers won at the score 109 against 110 what a score...
	Underrated superstar

	Cocaine is a hell of a drug 😂
	Light skin zebo

	Umm looks to me like LA Clippers lost at home
	I dunno whos drunk... is it me?

	I ❤️ him!!
	By winning, did you mean on your bet against the spread? 💰
	You mean LOSE.....

	Typo?
	Libra and Gemini
	Someone needs to get fired 💀
	Proofreading IS important! 😂
	Oh, the moral victory. GO LAKESHOW!!!🏀
	Crazy how the NBA still hasn’t edited this….
	Im like am I missing something?
	How the clippers won and the other team scored more points?……. How Sway!!?
	A guy like Loften JR doesn't care about the script. 😆
	Hey, ! You guys drunk or somethin'?
	This picture is confusing. The clippers won at home but the final score is 110-109 with the jazz winning.
	Lofton Jr. needs a team that will give him more playing time. This page needs an editor who knows his math.🤔
	Kenneth Lofton Jr.
	Does nobody proof read...?
	they want to get rid of him because he can exterminate 👽🛸
	won at home, what a shame
	I wish he got more time 🙌
	Looking like another Charles Barkley out there.
	Clippers won 109-110 🤣
	I like him, Bulls should scoop him up
	So 109-110 is a win?
	Looks like the clippers lost to me
	Did they now?
	Who won then? 🤣🤣
	I swear they purposely do this to get more engagement and comments lol .
	Imagine if he could stay away from fast food.
	He’s been underrated
	what was the captioooon?? haha
	Everyone knows 109&gt;110
	LOOK AT THE SCORE. 
	who really won?
	Grizzlies was dumber than to let him go. We lost a good player
	Is he Kenny Lofton’s son ?
	I'm confused, who won?!!!? 😄🤣
	
	It’s already several instances NBA page got into carelessness like this…might have to hire proof reader…
