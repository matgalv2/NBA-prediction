	Quite a pedestrian game for Luka. This boy is the true MVP..
	 message me private
	 Yup , He deserves it. But NBA  won't look his way.
	Luka Doncic is the best basketball player of all time.
	 go get therapy buddy.
	 u lost ur windy hair mind😒🚪🤓👄😭
	 yes
	 Just think,ir Luka were   black puting this numbers,AND breaking al the récords AND stats!
	
	 zan hon 😂
	 marina zany, aorinan'i Steph
	 Lillard n1
	 i hope he will be that but right now this is ridiculous take 😂💪
	Not a great shooting night but really not needed. Teammates stepping up !!
	As a warriors fan great job luka. I think you should take a break tommorow and not play a back to back 😂
	 no, Mavs will try revenge
	 I know I need him to chill lol
	 yall got a 4 game lead on the rockets youll be alright with a mavs win 😂😂😂
	Rax HengI honestly don't think it will matter ultimately 😑 gs been balling lately.  The warriors are playing like they're on a mission
	 mavs vs warriors out luka and erving  warriors out klay and wiggins
	 magpatalo yan bukas ang Mavs .. halatadong pinapanalo nila laban ngayon tapos bukas patalo yan sa Warriors
	Man luka is starting to really get his 3 down and his FT could go up to 83-85 eventually in the next 2 seasons.. defence is also slowly improving but he probably never gonna be the most elite defender instead he'll improve on doing what he can
	Luka doing his normal MVP routine at every game
	 yo what’s good hmu rn on messenger with your cashapp tag for random blessing 💰💯
	Crazy that this is his stat sheet when he has a bad game
	I watched the game. That mofo gets every call and cries like a baby when he doesn't.
	He’s the best player the hawks have ever drafted!
	Luka is better then Trae
	If not for a few bricks (THJ) he would have had the triple double.
	Luka is the best of all time.
	Basic Basketball for Dirks Wonder Boy. Luka Magic Time🫡
	That was a team win. Something that needed to be done before the playoffs. Luka came out 🥶, the team picked him up and they got the dub.
	 hell yeah and pj was clutch tonight with d jones
	 Imagine having a cold night and still put up 25-12-8.
	So murray shot 44 to get 44 points jb shots 47 to get 60 plus and they get laughed at but luka takes 25 shots to get 25 and you say he put in work lol
	 because he does. You haters really say anything these days. You didn't watch this game
	 this is actually a bad game for luka and still puts up good numbers. Got in foul trouble the first quarter and didn’t score a point.
	WAY TO GO MAVS! 💙💚🏀
	I was in attendance. Enjoyed it 💙
