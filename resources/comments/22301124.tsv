TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DAL	Quite a pedestrian game for Luka. This boy is the true MVP..
	Jeffrey Rivas message me private
	Jeffrey Rivas Yup , He deserves it. But NBA  won't look his way.
	Not a great shooting night but really not needed. Teammates stepping up !!
DAL	Luka Doncic is the best basketball player of all time.
	Renz Atienza go get therapy buddy.
ATL	😒🚪🤓👄😭
	Renz Atienza yes
DAL	Renz Atienza Just think,ir Luka were   black puting this numbers,AND breaking al the récords AND stats!
	Renz Atienza
DAL	😂
	Aina Rsnv marina zany, aorinan'i Steph
	Aleister Crowley Lillard n1
DAL	😂💪
DAL	As a warriors fan great job luka. I think you should take a break tommorow and not play a back to back 😂
DAL	Joel De Dios no, Mavs will try revenge
DAL	Rax Heng I know I need him to chill lol
	😂😂😂
	Rax HengI honestly don't think it will matter ultimately 😑 gs been balling lately.  The warriors are playing like they're on a mission
	Joel De Dios mavs vs warriors out luka and erving  warriors out klay and wiggins
	Joel De Dios magpatalo yan bukas ang Mavs .. halatadong pinapanalo nila laban ngayon tapos bukas patalo yan sa Warriors
DAL	Man luka is starting to really get his 3 down and his FT could go up to 83-85 eventually in the next 2 seasons.. defence is also slowly improving but he probably never gonna be the most elite defender instead he'll improve on doing what he can
DAL	Luka doing his normal MVP routine at every game
DAL	💰💯
DAL	I watched the game. That mofo gets every call and cries like a baby when he doesn't.
DAL	Crazy that this is his stat sheet when he has a bad game
	He’s the best player the hawks have ever drafted!
ATL	😂
DAL	If not for a few bricks (THJ) he would have had the triple double.
DAL	Luka is the best of all time.
DAL	Luka is better then Trae
DAL	Basic Basketball for Dirks Wonder Boy. Luka Magic Time🫡
DAL	So murray shot 44 to get 44 points jb shots 47 to get 60 plus and they get laughed at but luka takes 25 shots to get 25 and you say he put in work lol
	Marques Mitchell because he does. You haters really say anything these days. You didn't watch this game
	Marques Mitchell this is actually a bad game for luka and still puts up good numbers. Got in foul trouble the first quarter and didn’t score a point.
	That was a team win. Something that needed to be done before the playoffs. Luka came out 🥶, the team picked him up and they got the dub.
	Mark Richard hell yeah and pj was clutch tonight with d jones
	Mark Richard Imagine having a cold night and still put up 25-12-8.
	Robin Skålberg the trade’s definitely worked out
	Robin Skålberg that's when you know you got a solid team. They can make some noise
DAL	"He's stat padding at it's finest, and I'm from slovenia. He's one of the few guys allowed to rebound on the team, not to mention he's holding the ball 50% of the total time, and constantly ""passes"" the ball at the last second, so obviously his teammates need to throw, and he ramps up on assists that aren't assists at all."
DAL	WAY TO GO MAVS! 💙💚🏀
DAL	I was in attendance. Enjoyed it 💙
DAL	Lula mvp easily
