TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	He scored 24pts in the 4Q alone. His baskets are timely and his defense is elite. I never seen him play as efficient as this and I hope it continues untli playoffs time.
	I'll tell everyone again, if the Clippers dont ink a new PG13 contract and let PG walk away, they'll gonna regret it.
	Clippers about to send Luka home for the third time in the first round!!!
	 Mavs red hot rn, no chance
	 didn't even make the playoffs last year and the year before Kyrie was swept with KD. I like the Clippers chances lol especially since Ty Lue knows Kyrie better than anyone
	 clipp lose team🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	 might wanna Google Lukas W-L record against the Clippers it isn't good. That's why casuals only bring up his stats in those series as if it negates the Ls he still took 😂😂😂
	 Mavs has Luka and role players. Clippers in 4 😅
	 All these hating on Clippers are mostly Lakers fans. 🤣
	 Agreed. KAWHI owned him both regular season and the playoffs. 18-7 regular season and 8-5 playoffs.
	 save your luck
	 crazy that beating the Mavs in the postseason is the highlight of the year for Clipper fans
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Cleveland Cavaliers Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	dude had 9 fts in the 4th qtr alone.
	 refs helped the clippers in the final 3 mins
	Now He's showing He's a superstar ✨️
	 until he goes 4-17 next game like he normally does
	 he knows playoffs is coming, he's gonna park at that level the rest the games and playoffs
	Sign this guy into a new deal.Still better than Shai.I knew it
	I want to see a Lakers V Clippers playoff series, and so do you!
	The Cavs had a 26pts lead and scored 80pts in the 1st half and thought the had it 😂😂😂. 
	Cavs choked hard 😬
	PG will underachie the next 3 games. Her can't sustain this level of play anymore unfortunately
	Congratulations Clippers 🏆🏀
	Great win thanks for helping sixers
	 sixers 😳🤣🤣🤣🤣
	We don't need it but thanks anyway
	Almost a 40 piece! 🔥
	Naasar ako dito kanina Puro dribble tapos buwaya . ayaw mamasa pinipilit ang Tira . Pero kahit ganun panalo parin Congrats Los Angeles clippers Lakers ...
	Oo nga kasalanan ni PG yan kung bat natalo ang cavs 
	 lt utak niyan boss pang over class 😭
	Great win 🏆
	Ppl keep sleeping 😴 the clippers got the championship potential for 2024 if they stay healthy for once 🏆
	Just 4 more games to play!
	Love it!
	🔥🔥🔥
	Incroyable 😭❤
	Very good!come fr.behind ,wow
	My question is, what's the point of signing a max-contract to a player who rarely scores 20+ point consecutively? 150+ millions in 3 years for what? No championship, no mvp's, no even in the conversation, no nothing, and every year is the same
	All hail King George ! 👑
	I’m
	So cavs scored 38 the whole second half? Got to be kidding me
	❤
	The clippers came back from down 26 points but it does not change the fact that PG13 is such a good regular season player but he mostly chocks in the post season. He must be remembered by the name Dame time
	 Kawhi will take over, easy as that .
	 chocks? Aral ka muna 😂
	 inggitero hahaha just watch
	 Funny you name Dame Tike considering his championship cabinet is as empty as PG’s, he’s a choker too.
	 you must be a hater for the Clippers team! Can you do better?
	The clippers sucks they always gets the teams that coming on a back to back.. They never play the teams first the lakers have to soften the teams up for them.. lol 😂😂
	 lakers are not even in a playoff spot where clippers are 4th so what are you talking about stupid
	
	 jared snyder you are a waste of nine months… Did I said anything about lakers are in the playoffs??? 🤡🤡🤡
	 you good bud ?
	 Lakers the play in team ?
	Good, but Cavs totally droped the ending, dejavu like Detroit dropped ending at the Nets.
	PG is him 💪😤🙌🔥 Let's go Clippers!!!
	Playoff ready ❤✌
	No Kawhi for the game and no James in the 4th quarter. We a take the W 💪🏽
	Won $4000 great comeback
	Paul George 👌🏿🏀
	PG was great but Cavs came from 9/18 from deep ....to 2/12 from deep. at 2th half.
	Congrats lca
	sarap 7.1 odds
	Clips in 6 😤🔥💯
	Unbelievable!!
	PG lod i💪
	💪🏻💪🏻👏👏👏
	 atabs mo galing talaga eh
	PG拼了這季沒拿冠軍就轉隊，快艇從一開始最被看好，到後來被認為欠缺最後一搏能力，今年更困難
	 para maganda daw gising mo hahahahaha
	open k biết hay không
