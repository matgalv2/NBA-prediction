TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	He scored 24pts in the 4Q alone. His baskets are timely and his defense is elite. I never seen him play as efficient as this and I hope it continues untli playoffs time.
LAC	I'll tell everyone again, if the Clippers dont ink a new PG13 contract and let PG walk away, they'll gonna regret it.
LAC	Clippers about to send Luka home for the third time in the first round!!!
	Bobby Warden Mavs red hot rn, no chance
LAC	Thomas Milliken didn't even make the playoffs last year and the year before Kyrie was swept with KD. I like the Clippers chances lol especially since Ty Lue knows Kyrie better than anyone
CLE	🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LAC	😂😂😂
LAC	😅
CLE	🤣
LAC	Bobby Warden Agreed. KAWHI owned him both regular season and the playoffs. 18-7 regular season and 8-5 playoffs.
	Bobby Warden save your luck
LAC	Bobby Warden crazy that beating the Mavs in the postseason is the highlight of the year for Clipper fans

	Very good!come fr.behind ,wow
LAC	My question is, what's the point of signing a max-contract to a player who rarely scores 20+ point consecutively? 150+ millions in 3 years for what? No championship, no mvp's, no even in the conversation, no nothing, and every year is the same
	💩🤡🗑🤦‍♂️😆😆😆😆
	Voskher Owono go get a life
	Voskher Owono how does one average 22ppg over 71 games and not score over 20ppg consecutively?

LAC	The clippers came back from down 26 points but it does not change the fact that PG13 is such a good regular season player but he mostly chocks in the post season. He must be remembered by the name Dame time
	Pinoy memes Kawhi will take over, easy as that .
	😂
	Pinoy memes inggitero hahaha just watch
	Pinoy memes https://t.me/+giJaUtpX5-FhNDNk
	Pinoy memes Funny you name Dame Tike considering his championship cabinet is as empty as PG’s, he’s a choker too.
	Pinoy memes you must be a hater for the Clippers team! Can you do better?
LAC	The clippers sucks they always gets the teams that coming on a back to back.. They never play the teams first the lakers have to soften the teams up for them.. lol 😂😂
	Earl Mascoll lakers are not even in a playoff spot where clippers are 4th so what are you talking about stupid
	Jared Snyder
CLE	🤡🤡🤡
	Earl Mascoll you good bud ?
	Earl Mascoll Lakers the play in team ?
	Good, but Cavs totally droped the ending, dejavu like Detroit dropped ending at the Nets.
