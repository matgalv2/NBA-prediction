	I think their worst ever season (don’t quote me) was 96-97, when they went 20-62. In spite of what I know they’re doing, I’d like them to reach 20 or 21 wins.
	 Man you Spurs fans all clowns Wemby so overrated
	 let's see that in 2 years
	 he's definitely not overrated. People see him for his potential and not where he's at.
	 15th place 🤡
	Le James best prospect in 20 years and the numbers don’t lie. Let’s not act like Jordan Kobe Lebron etc came into the nba winning at the highest level.
	 Rasheed Wallace called him a bust
	 Rasheed Wallace was probably the 5th best player on the pistons last championship team so his word must be true . The guy with the most technical fouls in a season, yeah I’ll past on his judgement 😅
	 if anyone was a bust it was Rasheed getting drafted before KG….
	 Spurs fans be like we’ll get the greatest 2nd pick and win 5 straight something Duncan failed to do lol Spurs were a weak champion always losing to an 8th seed
	 Duncan is the reason there’s super teams today . Lebron in his own words said he stacked teams to compete with the spurs but you knew that. 
	 TMZ breaking news Wemby broken foot haha
	 breaking news! you can’t stay on topic and can’t add anything of substance to this thread. Btw good answer to my question 😅
	" that guy is an absolute troll. Imagine hating a classy organization runned and played with the most humble owner, GM, coaching staff and players that has been a model of success in most sports. Spurs never deserve any of that, but the team … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 TMZ breaking news Wemby goes back to reject league
	 50+ seasons but loss to an 8th seed, 7th seed, 6th seed, and 5th seed they were a joke
	 I asked you who beat better competition not an ignorant opinion.  Your favorite player missed the playoffs all together and couldn’t  lose to any seeds because his team wasn’t good enough for the playoffs how many times?
	 Loss to an 8th seed nothing more pathetic!
	Give the Spurs 2 years. We're coming.
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Utah Jazz
	Why can’t he play like this more consistently? The Jazz aren’t a good team, that’s why he went off. lol
	Spurs coming for the chip 😁
	This is a great game.
	💪💪💪
	Kd and the phoenix suns W over the nuggets
	 the spurs beating the suns last week without wemby was far more impressive 😅
	This player in underrated
	💎💎💎
	GO SPURS
	🖤🖤🖤 GSG
	I like how he's just called Wemby instead of Victor Wembanyama 😂
	Vassell is seriously overlooked because he's in Wemby's shadow on a team with a bad record
	Nobody notice this buh Devin Vassel is a killa
	Devin Vassell
	The spurs are a terrible team. 🤷‍♂️
	Devin Vassell a stunner
	Utah Jazz is probably the worst team in the NBA !
