TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I think their worst ever season (don’t quote me) was 96-97, when they went 20-62. In spite of what I know they’re doing, I’d like them to reach 20 or 21 wins.
	Jeff Reese Man you Spurs fans all clowns Wemby so overrated
	Le James let's see that in 2 years
	Le James he's definitely not overrated. People see him for his potential and not where he's at.
	🤡
	Le James best prospect in 20 years and the numbers don’t lie. Let’s not act like Jordan Kobe Lebron etc came into the nba winning at the highest level.
	M.J. Bx Sr. Rasheed Wallace called him a bust
	😅
	Le James if anyone was a bust it was Rasheed getting drafted before KG….
	Jeff Reese Spurs fans be like we’ll get the greatest 2nd pick and win 5 straight something Duncan failed to do lol Spurs were a weak champion always losing to an 8th seed
	Le James Duncan is the reason there’s super teams today . Lebron in his own words said he stacked teams to compete with the spurs but you knew that. 
	M.J. Bx Sr. TMZ breaking news Wemby broken foot haha
	😅
	M.J. Bx Sr. that guy is an absolute troll. Imagine hating a classy organization runned and played with the most humble owner, GM, coaching staff and players that has been a model of success in most sports. Spurs never deserve any of that, but the team and player that that troll is worshipping.
	M.J. Bx Sr. TMZ breaking news Wemby goes back to reject league
	M.J. Bx Sr. 50+ seasons but loss to an 8th seed, 7th seed, 6th seed, and 5th seed they were a joke
	Le James I asked you who beat better competition not an ignorant opinion.  Your favorite player missed the playoffs all together and couldn’t  lose to any seeds because his team wasn’t good enough for the playoffs how many times?
	M.J. Bx Sr. Loss to an 8th seed nothing more pathetic!
	Give the Spurs 2 years. We're coming.
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Utah Jazz
	Why can’t he play like this more consistently? The Jazz aren’t a good team, that’s why he went off. lol
	Spurs coming for the chip 😁
	This is a great game.
	This player in underrated
	Kd and the phoenix suns W over the nuggets
	😅
	💪💪💪
	💎💎💎
	GO SPURS
	🖤🖤🖤 GSG
	I like how he's just called Wemby instead of Victor Wembanyama 😂
	Vassell is seriously overlooked because he's in Wemby's shadow on a team with a bad record
	Nobody notice this buh Devin Vassel is a killa
	Devin Vassell
	The spurs are a terrible team. 🤷‍♂️
	Joey Morris you’re just now figuring that out? Tell us something we don’t know.
	Joey Morris besides the Wizards and Pistons have the worst record.
	Devin Vassell a stunner
	Utah Jazz is probably the worst team in the NBA !
	fake stats
	legitimately paying off debts of first 5 struggling people to hit up…
