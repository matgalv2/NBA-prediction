	Having 2 ball handlers that can get u 8 assist each and a guybon the bench that can get 4 or 5 is huge for a team that doesn't have a great paint presence rn. Keeping the ball moving like they did tn is thier best option rn
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
	Definitely not used to seeing him in a sixers jersey yet
	Ethan Sunier I struggle with this as a Celtic
	Buddy Hield
	🏀
	Lol say he highest scoring game, when he only played two game and score one more point than the first game 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sometimes these captions does make me laugh.
	Aye Rolle it's an accomplishment for him when he wasn't even scraping 20 as a Pacer. He is definitely more efficient as a sixer tho it plagues me to say.
	Buddy buckets all day everyday,just 🔌 and play It doesn't matter what Jersey or city same energy all the time every time.💯🙏🏾🙌🏾
	All the people that complained about losing depth and 2029 2nd rd picks for a starting SG, wonder if they still feel the same?
	The Philadelphia 76ers are still fighting after the Cleveland Cavaliers' 9-game winning streak ended
