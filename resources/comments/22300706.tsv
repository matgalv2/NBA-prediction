	Eric Terracciano they literally have the best record in the NBA list off all the top teams right now and the Celtics have beaten most of them too
	Eric Terracciano why we in first place why why why is your team not for us place why? Team is in first place. You could run your mouth till then shush.

	Best player in the league bar none. Not even close to be fair. Honorable mention for the horse farmer who swept the self proclaimed king. 
	CJ Avery no he's not. He's not better than Giannis or jokic.
	Frank Cooley Jr Jokic probably not but definitely better than Giannis… Giannis can’t shoot and he sucks in the clutch
	Stephen Crompton false.
	Buwaya tatum
