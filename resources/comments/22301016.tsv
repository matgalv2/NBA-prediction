	Bill Elvis it’s not looking like a race. The lakers are starting to separate with multiple wins while the warriors are adding more losses

	To everyone saying oh Lakers better than warriors may I remind you what curry did to LeBron when he was on the Cavs what was it oh 3 rings to 1 ring I'm sorry but try again PS maybe just maybe not letting LeBron become GM saying I want my friends on my team now they ruined the Lakers future have fun once LeBron leaves or retires
	Warriors had a cool run,but that’s over now. Time to breakup the band.
	Awesome
	Well done Tyrese , got that W💯
	accept the Truth gstae fans your trash team wont make playin mark my words because rockets are on a winning push
