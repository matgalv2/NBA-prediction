TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Best shot for banner 18 we have had in a while. This Celtics team plays good team ball and gets it done. Tatum isn’t always the lead scorer but he gets done what needs doing!
	I know this team is racking up the wins but it still feels like they’re vulnerable in the playoffs. Their bench is suspect and Tatum and Brown still run hot and cold.
	Calvin Ted Watlington Is there any team though where you could say their stars are always hot and who's bench is always good?
	Harry Bowman It will be interesting to see how this plays out. BTW, lived in Canberra for three years, and Sydney was my getaway place while I was there. I loved it!
	Last time we just beat dem 2 years almost did a Reverse Sweep on The Heat If it wouldn't for JT got injured Wat Miami??
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Boston Celtics
	You can celebrate all you want Boston fans. Enjoy it while it lasts. You won't get out of the East in the playoffs.
	Celtics running hot until they meet Miami
	Rena Chiddick
	Rena Chiddick how'd that work out?
	Rena Chiddick Meh. Heat did not even win a single game against the Celtics this season. And before you point out that they won against them in the playoffs last season, let's not forget that the Celtics have beaten them in the playoffs before.
	Rena Chiddick lol u realize  miami is barely  in playoff contention  right 🤣🤣
	Rena Chiddick you mean beating them 3 times this year?
	Rena Chiddick kkkkkkkkk buttler transforms into an all star when he plays JT
	Rena Chiddick Yall know Miami  is nothing when they play against us for the whole regular season we beat their ass too much
	Big deal. Everybody beating the Sixers these days🤣
	NBA- with your agreement to 2k you are allowing them to, 
	Heat will eliminate them

	Brian Wayne Boyett got you.  Jayson Tatum is gonna retire with zero rings ! There I said it !!! 
	Lucas Dagnone you're going to retire a fan. One who wished so badly that you could do a fraction of the things that a professional athlete could do
	Lucas: No way Tatum's getting a ring.
	Lucas Dagnone hating boy hating boy😁
	Allister Sebastian never that he got the same rings as my NJ nets. Big fat 0
