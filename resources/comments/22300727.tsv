TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	good thing wiggins step up when curry had an off night shooting! back to back wins for the #warriors!!! 🙂
	Pinoy Ako he didn’t really have an “off night” he just didn’t shoot at all
	Peter Georgeades you could still say it’s an off night for him if he’s only able to get off 7 shots

	Bench the one trick pony, that is the key to success for Warriors! I'm not a Warriors fan but i'm giving this coaching tip for free! Better ball movement and better offensive plays, with improved defense if Kerr benches Curry!
	Mel Yonaryo they don’t need any tips from a keyboard warrior.
	Mel Yonaryo you're a clown bro!! Can't you see curry being a decoy allows his teammates to score

	Mel Yonaryo that's the exact reason why no one would ever ask you to coach anything at all 😆
	Golden State Warriors Vs Philadelphia 76ers
	This is the 2022 Wiggins we all witnessed in the past,keep that energy 💛💙
	Onto play offs!!
	The warriors might not be the best team right now but they always beat the big boys in the league 👏👏👏
	Wiggins' double-double helped the Golden State Warriors beat Philadelphia! Kuminga and Martin also excelled with stats.
	Awesome energy.  Keep soaring JK.  Go Warriors!
	Well done AW22.. Keep it up.❤️❤️❤️
	Warriors this season showed how their time is coming to an end, before it was guarantee each night for them to win now gotta start betting live with them.
	NL Skima facts
	We are struggling because this man refuses to play the dominant role that he can play... When he decides to assert himself, GSW becomes dangerous...
	Warriors have The Best wings in the NBA w/ Wigs and JK.
	All I want as a warriors fan is for them to be consistent every night.
	Trade Curry to the Pistons. That's the only way the warriors can go back to their best performance.
	him and Kaly Thompson is the reason there losing
	He is just having a down season.. i hope je ge5s to comeback stronger..
	"It's funny when Nuggets fans were saying ""Jokic willed his team to the playoffs"" when their starting 5 was banged up yet with Embiid gone this 76ers team looks like the east coast pistons....who is really more valuable to the team here"
	All they need is haircut now it’s klay thompson time 🙏🏼😊😃
	if AW can play with JK is great.....hope he can keep the performance like this
	Lebron - King 👑
	SE AN lebron james the KING off flopping the goat off sweeping lebron james 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	SE AN le tantrum 💀
	SE AN nba's crying baby bron
	For football betting fans
	SE AN ikaw king kong
	SE AN king of turnovers🤣🤣
	MUY   BIEN   ESO   ES   LO  QUE   SE   NESECITA   GANAR   JUEGOS    AUN    SIN   LOS   PUNTOS   DE    CURRY      ESE  ES  EL   JUEGO   QUE  ESTA  HACIENDO  FALTA  PARA   AVANZAR
	Congrats GSW

	2 wins to go then we will take the 10 spot
	Edrian Dorado 8th spot must be achievable
	For football betting fans
