	Jaylen over on points been hitting a lot lately
	I’m rooting for any team but the Celtics, Tatum is trash and can’t get to the rim without his constant offensive foul. It’s lame watching him blatantly shove his defender every single time and the refs swallow their whistle every time
	Dude is playing his best year!
	The Celtics don't need the wins man 😂😂 should just give the struggling teams wins man c'mon 😂
	 nah ain’t letting shit rock 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	I’m not sold on the Celtics yet. They stay choking in the playoffs for the past 2-3 seasons now. I’m hoping they can figure it out and do better this time around.
	 who cares
	 clearly you do because here you are commenting smh. I wasn’t even talking negative about them but any true Celtics fan understands exactly what I’m saying. I’m sure every true fan cares if they win a chip or not so I’m not even sure what you’re talking about lol.
	 👍🏾
	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪
	Tapos malaglag sa semis
	 hahaha sinabi mopa haha

	Son bottom line if Boston and Connecticut win the championship this year then you the man that's what count
	 🤣🤣
	Relax , it’s just Pistons
	Millionaire
	You know what I like about jaylen brown? Is when Tatum isn't doing so well he picks up attacks and gets the job done CELTICNATION BABY!!!! 🍀💚🍀💚🍀
	 I like the Celtics but they stay choking in the playoffs. For the past 2-3 seasons now. I hope they can do better this time around.
	 bro I feel you on that when they lost to Miami last year was because of them damn turnovers I was getting sick too the year before that they faced I believe golden state I knew they wasn't winning that cause Curry was too hot with the 3's I want them to win the championship too that's my team love my Celtics
	 yeah man they need to win a chip! Would be a good look for Tatum and Brown.
	 yeah well if Tatum doesn’t go missing in all but 2-3 games in the finals we might have a chance regular season player brown put him on his back, but now there’s more support at the forefront and the bench if they stay healthy !
	 yeah to be honest it’s really Tatum that be choking in the playoffs. I’m not sure why that is. Maybe they got it together this season
	 yeah brother I agree I don’t know why they make him the face when it really do be brown doing all the hard work and that’s from a lifelong Celtic fan !
	 I mean don’t get me wrong Tatum is really good but it just seems during playoff time he forgets how to play and I’m not sure why that is. And I’ve been following them as I said for the past 2-3 seasons and it’s always the same thing with him so I don’t know. I would love to see him and Brown win it all for sure but I don’t know.
	 I like the Celtics but they stay choking in the playoffs. For the past 2-3 seasons now. I’m hoping they figure it out and do better this time around.
	Esa vaina no sorprende ni loco que uno te Boston Celtics el equipoooo con mejor diferencial de toda NBA ante unos de los peores equipo con la P mayúsculas de la conferencia Este este equipo de Detroit Pistons tiene un diferencial horrible de puntos <a tabindex=🪫🪫 aunque la tiene pueta con Tatum en cancha también
