TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Jaylen over on points been hitting a lot lately
	I’m rooting for any team but the Celtics, Tatum is trash and can’t get to the rim without his constant offensive foul. It’s lame watching him blatantly shove his defender every single time and the refs swallow their whistle every time
	Dude is playing his best year!
	The Celtics don't need the wins man 😂😂 should just give the struggling teams wins man c'mon 😂
	🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	I’m not sold on the Celtics yet. They stay choking in the playoffs for the past 2-3 seasons now. I’m hoping they can figure it out and do better this time around.
	Dale Gilkes who cares
	Khadijat Bello clearly you do because here you are commenting smh. I wasn’t even talking negative about them but any true Celtics fan understands exactly what I’m saying. I’m sure every true fan cares if they win a chip or not so I’m not even sure what you’re talking about lol.

	Let’s go Celtics ☘️☘️💪💪💪

	Dizzy Alexander I like the Celtics but they stay choking in the playoffs. For the past 2-3 seasons now. I hope they can do better this time around.
	Dale Gilkes bro I feel you on that when they lost to Miami last year was because of them damn turnovers I was getting sick too the year before that they faced I believe golden state I knew they wasn't winning that cause Curry was too hot with the 3's I… Wyświetl więcej
	Dizzy Alexander yeah man they need to win a chip! Would be a good look for Tatum and Brown.
	Dale Gilkes yeah well if Tatum doesn’t go missing in all but 2-3 games in the finals we might have a chance regular season player brown put him on his back, but now there’s more support at the forefront and the bench if they stay healthy !
	Joey Barton yeah to be honest it’s really Tatum that be choking in the playoffs. I’m not sure why that is. Maybe they got it together this season
	Dale Gilkes yeah brother I agree I don’t know why they make him the face when it really do be brown doing all the hard work and that’s from a lifelong Celtic fan !
	Joey Barton I mean don’t get me wrong Tatum is really good but it just seems during playoff time he forgets how to play and I’m not sure why that is. And I’ve been following them as I said for the past 2-3 seasons and it’s always the same thing with hi… Wyświetl więcej
