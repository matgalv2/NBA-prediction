	Escobar Franklin he always need a baller he just needed to get comfortable with the heat system. He doesn’t want to step on jimmy toes by taking over games but at this point jimmy hasn’t been the jimmy butler we been use to so f**k it Rozier take flight &amp; ever wants to join him in scoring then let’s go. The heat have more than enough to win another championship
