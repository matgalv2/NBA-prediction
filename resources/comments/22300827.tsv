	Tj Flores sure buddy 😂.. good luck in that play in 😂
	Tj Flores So the Kings won the game and didn't disappoint the fans.
	Con todo el respeto a Oscar Robertson que para mi  D Aaron fox es su remplazo fox y domanthas Sabonis son los dos jugadores que yo he visto de los kings con más impacto en este momento  los números son muy bueno estos dos muchacho promedia Fox promedia 26.8 puntos por partido el 5 mejor armador con más puntos y 4 oye esa vaina por encima del están en la conferencia oeste líderes shai gilgeous Alexander Luka doncic Stheph Curry y después sigue Fox está entre lo 4 mejores anotadores en Meta de campo es decir que casi encesta mucha bolas por partido con 9.7 y en este partido 9 tiros de campo echo anotados y también es 2 en robos de la NBA Fox con un 1.9 por partido y domathas Sabonis líder en triple doble con 20 está en el top 11 de mejores anotadores como forward como ala pívot especialmente que eh su posición hay lo entiendo por qué no lo valoran mucho pero miren cuánto promedia 20.1 altísimo para ser un 11 lugar pero mira eso domanthas Sabonis líderes en Rebotes 13.2 en rebotes está temporada entre forward Center Guard Sabonis es líder entre todos en rebotes y tiene 54 doble doble eta temporada que no eh chin
	Whooped dat ass. The light the beam chants in the end was cherry on top of the icing.
	"""Best team in the NBA right now might win the championship as well w/ the addition of harden"" 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🥱 championship my as$"
	Sabonis with another triple double and I think he either passed or tied Oscar Robertson for the most in a season in franchise history
	harden is back to his old self.  missing shots and taking lots of free throws 😆
	Sabonis with a Triple Double
	Ras Carter https://t.me/+pP2_Jwj7CXBiNWY0
	And this dude together  with domas got snubbed in the allstar for some washed up dudes
	Lakers and Kings fans in the arena joined force. They were all chanting Lets go kings after the game. They can all suck each other. Kings will get eliminated in the 1st round and Lakers gets eliminated in the Play in.
	Fox couldn't hit a barn door for 3.
	Couldn’t hit a single damn 3 smh sold my parlay
	Congratulations💯💯💯

	It's a shame that Mr. Fox was not part of the All Stars which he deserved.

	You would have thought the Kings, 5th place in the tough west and 10 games over .500, were the laughing stock of the NBA listening to NBA on ESPN’s Bob Meyers.  What an awful, unprofessional first half of color commentary, I was embarrassed for him.
	Danny McKevitt seriously he was trash
	Non all star Sabonis had a league leading 20th triple double by like halftime. Leads the league in double doubles and triple doubles but not an all star. What a joke.
	Patrick Dunn Dear Don't Skip,
