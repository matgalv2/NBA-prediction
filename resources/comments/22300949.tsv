TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DEN	Moj tim, moja simpatija; puno ih obožavam. Denver kad je kompaktan i raspoložen, oni  su ne  pobjedivi.

DEN	MPJ great game and team work 💕
DEN	So long as mpj is playing like this, the nuggets are going to be unbeatable
DEN	Spirlin Jay I think he’ll be ready in the big games this year. Last year he went cold toward the end of the playoffs. His rebounding is always good too. If Watson develops a consistent 3 they’ll be way scarier
DEN	Spirlin Jay Agreed. They won a championship with him laying bricks the entire finals. He plays like this throughout the playoffs it’s a wrap.
DEN	Spirlin Jay Couldn't agree more. He's the x factor and when they have Jackson, Braun and Watson contributing too, they're unstoppable.
DEN	Jokic had an average game, but just his presence was enough to deter the Heat from the win. The other stepped up tonight 🔥
DEN	the Denver Nuggets owns the Miami Heat 💯
DEN	Anghel Nikolas including lakers and gsw
DEN	Anghel Nikolas everyone does. It’s not that hard.
DEN	The Denver Nuggets own the NBA right now. Lol
DEN	The fact that Reggie went off at the end when it mattered the most was insane🔥
DEN	Angel Garcia Joker setting those high screens and Reggie wasn't hitting nothing but the net with those shots. Fantastic offense.
DEN	Why didn't they include the assists he made? Oh wait, it's MPJ. 😅
DEN	Y'all were supposed to score 215 or more combined points but good game.
