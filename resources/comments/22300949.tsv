	Moj tim, moja simpatija; puno ih obožavam. Denver kad je kompaktan i raspoložen, oni  su ne  pobjedivi.
	 nas team 😏
	when was the last time the miami heat beat the nuggets?🤔🤔
	 When Indomie super pack was 50naira
	 it's starting to feel like they can't even comprehend it.
	 during the 2023 nba finals, on game 2
	 probably before Joker had Morris goofy a*s laid out on the court 😂
	MPJ great game and team work 💕
	So long as mpj is playing like this, the nuggets are going to be unbeatable
	 I think he’ll be ready in the big games this year. Last year he went cold toward the end of the playoffs. His rebounding is always good too. If Watson develops a consistent 3 they’ll be way scarier
	 Agreed. They won a championship with him laying bricks the entire finals. He plays like this throughout the playoffs it’s a wrap.
	 Couldn't agree more. He's the x factor and when they have Jackson, Braun and Watson contributing too, they're unstoppable.
	Jokic had an average game, but just his presence was enough to deter the Heat from the win. The other stepped up tonight 🔥
	the Denver Nuggets owns the Miami Heat 💯
	 including lakers and gsw
	 everyone does. It’s not that hard.
	The Denver Nuggets own the NBA right now. Lol
	The fact that Reggie went off at the end when it mattered the most was insane🔥
	 Joker setting those high screens and Reggie wasn't hitting nothing but the net with those shots. Fantastic offense.
	Why didn't they include the assists he made? Oh wait, it's MPJ. 😅
	Y'all were supposed to score 215 or more combined points but good game.
	Nugget now #1 in the west!!!
	 Dallas
	 #10 vs #9 winner vs #8 play-in
	Home town HERO. Columbia, Mo in the house♥️💙
