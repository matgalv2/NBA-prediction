	Moj tim, moja simpatija; puno ih obožavam. Denver kad je kompaktan i raspoložen, oni  su ne  pobjedivi.
	😏
	when was the last time the miami heat beat the nuggets?🤔🤔
	Joshua Azi When Indomie super pack was 50naira
	Tyem Pirfa it's starting to feel like they can't even comprehend it.

	MPJ great game and team work 💕
	So long as mpj is playing like this, the nuggets are going to be unbeatable
	Spirlin Jay I think he’ll be ready in the big games this year. Last year he went cold toward the end of the playoffs. His rebounding is always good too. If Watson develops a consistent 3 they’ll be way scarier
	Spirlin Jay Agreed. They won a championship with him laying bricks the entire finals. He plays like this throughout the playoffs it’s a wrap.
	Spirlin Jay Couldn't agree more. He's the x factor and when they have Jackson, Braun and Watson contributing too, they're unstoppable.
	Jokic had an average game, but just his presence was enough to deter the Heat from the win. The other stepped up tonight 🔥
	the Denver Nuggets owns the Miami Heat 💯
	Anghel Nikolas including lakers and gsw
	Anghel Nikolas everyone does. It’s not that hard.
	The Denver Nuggets own the NBA right now. Lol
	The fact that Reggie went off at the end when it mattered the most was insane🔥
	Angel Garcia Joker setting those high screens and Reggie wasn't hitting nothing but the net with those shots. Fantastic offense.
	Why didn't they include the assists he made? Oh wait, it's MPJ. 😅
	Y'all were supposed to score 215 or more combined points but good game.
