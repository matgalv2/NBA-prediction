TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
NYK	Last night's game can be a defining game for them. It showed how much grit and will they had. Alot of guys stepped up last night!!! Hope Jalen is ok. Way to go team!!!
	When one person goes down, that’s an opportunity for one to shine.. When two people go down, in comes another opportunity. But damn.. Enough with the injuries coach. lol
NYK	He played well for the Knicks
NYK	Can't wait to face Cleveland in the finals.

NYK	Man I hope we get our team back full healthy and ready for the playoffs. I don’t care what anyone says, if the Knicks roster is healthy and in game shape top to bottom they have the potential to beat anyone! Certainly wouldn’t be easy but they’d have a serious shot!
NYK	Knicks stole Donte from the Warriors. Great signing,he’s been lights out all season long 🏀🔥
	New York Knicks Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
NYK	Once A Knick, Always a Knick'...!!!
	Fantastic signing.
	Knicks ganaron pero una horrible y no tan alegre y buena noticia que su Point guard base armador de to lo día líder en puntos del equipo jaylen Bruson se lesiono la rodilla en un salto de suspención y eso ya suena cansante primero Mitchell Robinson el pivot titular de nueva York y después OG Anunoby y Julius Randle algo que es muy fustrante por qué el trabajo de eso tres hombres eh jugar titular todos los días pa darle la victoria a este equipo y entonces tom Thibodeau va tener que usar su banca algo que a ningún coach no le gusta para nada dependiendo como sean los jugadores pero eso último 3 son titulares de por vida con los Knicks y Robinson también y divichezo aprovechando el muy buen chance que los Knicks le están dando como shooting guard escolta y hablando de escolta yo lo dije cleveland Cavaliers sin su escolta titular guard base y escolta Donovan Mitchell no va ni para nigún lado 7-6 pero mira que porcentaje de puntos por partido no meten terror así ni loco los cavs 109.5 osea Donovan Mitchell le hace el dis feliz a los Cavs casi en todo lo juegos y eso eh verdad cuando el está en el tablocillo todo cambia 115.7 en puntos por partido algo muy bueno y su récord superior 32-15 demasiado bueno y Michell a estado como 13 juegos lesionao está temporada el guard titular de los Cavs y Michell es la bujía de hay
NYK	The Nova culture ✌️
NYK	It's a wonderful game.
NYK	AWESOMENESS
NYK	Should’ve posted Josh hart
NYK	David Easton Donte had 28 points! Just be happy with the win!
NYK	David Easton we don’t win without both of them playing elite ball.
NYK	Great game tonight 3/3 u guys really stepped up to get the win.  Donte can someone please tell me what those 4 red cicles are on your shoulder?
NYK	Carol Manthorp some athletes do this shit called suction cup therapy, where they attach suction cups to their arms and legs before a game or between the half. It’s supposed to relax your muscles or something, but it leaves those little circular marks on your shoulders. It’s more obvious on donte cuz he’s pale.
NYK	Carol Manthorp   It is from a physical therapy practice called cupping.  It draws layers of tissue and muscle apart to alleviate tightness, but leaves a wicked bruise.
NYK	Carol Manthorp I could be wrong but I'm guessing he takes acupuncture cupping therapy

NYK	As a knicks fan, I feel blessed and cursed. Cursed, because 4 of our starters are injured, and if we weren’t so screwed by injuries, we could be doing way better. Blessed, because we have a team of hard nosed high energy players, Hart and Donte being all over, all the time.
NYK	Big Raguuuuuu !!!! 💯💯💯💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽😮‍💨
NYK	It is no fukinnnn way they let HART get 19 rebounds lmfao 🤣 u can’t even make that shit up if u wanted too lol
