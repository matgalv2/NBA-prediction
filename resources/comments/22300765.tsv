TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	One of the worst calls to end a game I’ve seen. And on top of that 33 FT for Houston and 12 for the Knicks and it’s not like the Knicks weren’t driving in the paint. But of course refs will never face any consequences for dictating the outcome of games
	Frank Bennie there needs to be a change!!!
	Frank Bennie Refs do get
	Frank Bennie Hi
	The NBA hates the Knicks.
	Maciej Niemczyk it will never change.

	knee to the body is a foul kid
	Frank Bennie I usually agree the refs are bad. But in this game the Knicks jacked up a lot of shots and wasn’t aggressive in the first half. The Knicks committed a lot of stupid fouls. That last shot was body and Brunson had no reason to do all that
	Frank Bennie agree
	Frank Bennie cry
	Frank Bennie or maybe just maybe that knicks did nothing but foul ….. naw that wouldn’t ever cross your mind now would it

	the #rockets escaped with a victory against the #knicks, who suffered their 3rd straight defeats!!! congrats 🙂
	Knicks had a bunch of turnovers but that doesn't change the fact that the refs blatantly gave this game to Houston.
	Davis Simmons Hello Davis What’s up
	Davis Simmons lollll big surprise, a New York fan complaining.  Y'all just salty you lost to another Houston team.  Sengun gets fouled every other possession and rarely gets calls.  It's been happening all season.
	Rohan Ravishankar Sped.
	Rohan Ravishankar the Rockets got destroyed when both team were at full strength last month. I guess when your a terrible team like the Rockets you take wins however you can get them even when its aided by the refs.🤣😂🤣
	Derrick Parkinson lmao do some actual research before taking shots.  The rockets haven't had Tari Eason for quite some time.  He's their most important bench guy.  
	Rohan Ravishankar You are living in a serioid dream land. Tari Eason does not equate to the impact of 2 time all nba star Julius Randle much less OG Anunoby or Mitchell Robinson who are injured also. All these players have waaaay more impact than Eason and significantly better players than Eason. OG, Robinson and Julius represent 50 ppg, 25 rbg and 2.block per game to the Knicks. Compared to Tari 14 and 7.

	Davis Simmons agree
	Derrick Parkinson lol, I literally called out you blurbing stats and there you go.  Eason is literally the soul of the team.  Everyone plays better with him in the line up.  You can't quantify that, you have to watch the games and see which you clearly don't as you didn't even know he was gone.  
	The only wild thing is the NBA will continue to allow these refs to ruin games with impunity. This crew needs to be demoted to the g-league or fired straight up.
	Derrick Parkinson exactly the way they let Jalen get beat up was kinda scary and Houston is statistically a high fouling team and the Knicks only went to the free throw line 12 times to Houston’s 33 str8 laughable
	Derrick Parkinson agree
	This is the most I've seen New Yorkers care about the Knicks. Chill, neither team is going anywhere this year.
	Robert Barker when healthy the Knicks are top 3 in the east, maybe top 2.
	Salvatore Mazzola I'd take Celtics, Cavs, 76ers, Bucks, and probably even the Heat in a playoff series. There's probably another 8-9 teams in the west I'd pick over them. You're not winning a championship with Brunson as your best player.
	Robert Barker you’re making yourself sound like a hater, that’s about it.
	Salvatore Mazzola a hater of a mid team? There's 0% chance of them winning a championship. I didn't think saying that was controversial.
	Robert Barker you saying there are like 16 teams that are better than them is a little ridiculous
	Salvatore Mazzola considering I think they're mid, which they are, I'd say that's about right. I'd say anywhere in that 14th-17th range. Saying they have a shot at a championship is way more ridiculous.
	Robert Barker they just won like 16 out of 18, and plenty of those wins were against your top teams
	Robert Barker just say you don’t watch basketball. You a casual
	Robert Barker you’re definitely a casual who doesn’t watch basketball
	Robert Barker drugs are bad mkay
	GO Rockets 🚀
	Marcus D. Franklin ***refs
	Marcus D. Franklin go refs huh 😂
	They should investigate the refs immediately. Atrocious game
	Michael Palmer agree
	New York Knicks Vs Houston Rockets
	"Ed Malloy: ""After seeing it during postgame review, the offensive player was able to return to a normal playing position on the floor. The contact which occurred after the release of the ball therefore is incidental &amp; marginal to the shot attempt &amp; sho… Wyświetl więcej"
	Same play at the end of half and 4th quarter. Both offensive players kicked out toward the defenders closing out* after releasing a 3pt shot, but different calls made each time in favor of Houston. So inconsistent.
	The other wild part was the same ref made a couple of calls without having a good view of the play. One of which (out of bounds call) was overturned by the crew.
	Referee's name who blew the whistle on Brunson is Jacyn Goble... Make sure he hides his face next time he refs a game in NY, this guy is rigged and needs to be investigated.. there is a trail on him
	Chester Fuentes agree
	Every one of these refs should be immediately fired.
	The referee 😡mess this one up , the ref called this wrong, the refs, 🥵the refs, the ref 🤬
	You mean the refs let the Rockets win.
	Rockets and the refs with the dub lol
	Great job, Houston!!!
	Crazy how Adam silver hasn’t addressed the ref problem. There’s a reason for that, sports betting!
	He played good but terrible call to end the game and there’s no denying that when the refs apologized after the game 🤦🏻‍♂️
	Great officiating crew! 🤡🤡🤡
	Way to go HOUSTON ROCKETS‼️
	Hopefully Brunson did learn to not close out so hard in those:that situation. Don’t give the refs a chance to blow that whistle the Knick bias is a real thing
	Kevin Cronin 🤔
	12 freethrows to 33 for the rockets ?
	Kevin Cronin refs were clearly betting on the Knicks. You thought Tim Donoughy was the only gambling addict ref?
	great call, next question. - Brunson 🤣
	Refs need training simply put
	Refs had some where to go 😂
	This game was brought to in part by your friends at refball always here to remind that if the refs aren't having fun neither are you
	With the help of the referees
	Good win refs
	The crooked ref win the game  for Houston, investigate those ref silver
	Buen trabajo Houston
	Alperen Şengün kral adam 🇹🇷🇹🇷
	Refs need to be suspended,absolutely horrible officiating all game long smh disgusting 🤢.
	Lol this fcking league's has 0 integrity. 
	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
	JACYN GOBLE is the referee. If the NBA is going to allow rigging games then this is what needs to be done. Here is some background information on this guy and his family:
	Stupid not wild. Stupid and disrespectful to the game.
	The officiating this season has been worse than abysmal.  From obvious missed calls to phantom fouls.  Even the replay center can't get calls right sometimes.  Tonight the refs were three blind mice.
	Hey NBA, what’s up with your refs?
	$$$$$$$$$ so obvious. The NBA doesn't care how corrupt their officials are
	They had 8 men on the floor.
	Joseph Jones El  Gibson lol 😆 😂 🤣 😄 😅 what is it with this guy , is thibs 
	With the help of refree for win,naks ,,bad call of refree,,
	Rockets shoot 21 more free throws than their opponents &amp; no one bats an eye
	Knicks overrated will fall hard
	My knicks got robbed
	STAY TUNED ON UPCOMING MATCH FOR THE LAKERS. LAKERS WILL BE THE NBA CHAMPION FOR THE 2023-2024 SEASON🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
	Malloy and his crew need to be investigated 🖕
	Houston la hot 🔥

	I’m actually impressed with the world renowned sloppy toppy Dylan brooks gave the refs before the game, since literally every single call went the rockets’ way, Dylan must be the best knob-slobber in the world.
	Some of the worst officiating I've seen at any level, and I was an official for over 40 years. 
	I'd be hard pressed to allow this 
	Update:  Officiating Crew looks at video AFTER the game, then decides they blew the call at the end of the game admitting there was no foul by Jalen Brunson ?!? Why the heck are we spending all this time watching video during the game only to have offi… Wyświetl więcej

	Karma for Brunson.
	Dillion Brooks
	Boooooooooooooooo
	NBA I wouldn’t be proud to post such a story, a wild ending? What’s wild is the refs were allowed to decide the outcome on what looked to be arguably the most contact-less call I’ve ever seen in a basketball game.  In this scenario any foul called in the last X seconds of a game should be automatically reviewed by the ref center or whatever it’s called ..not a good look guys.
	Mark Garcia no foul
	NBA page has some nerve to post this garbage. The game was rigged or poorly officiated. END OF STORY!
	Houston Refs you mean
	Career high?
	These are the “refs” from tonights Rockets-Knicks game. They need to be looked into. Ed Malloy, Jacyn Goble, Andy Nagy. Its ruining the game
	Totally Robbed
