	At least they'll have something to be proud of after their first round exit from the playoffs
	I love watching them play!
	LeBron James is the Greatest of all time next to MJ, Steph, Kobe, and Duncan..
	This is how he has to play for the Pacers to go deep. Go for rebounds always and shoot many shots. He is a good player
	you know there's something wrong with the NBA when you see a team score 150+ points...
	this is absolutely the worst case scenario for the bucks 😐
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Indiana Pacers
	Love my !!!  💙💛🏀
	Any other game this bum wanna have 10 pts and 3 rebounds
	Good job
	
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Bucks first round exit against their team owner Tyrese Haliburton confirmed 😩😭💀🤣
	Mr inconsistent
	Turner's so underrated.
	Lets go hawks ! Finals bound !💪🏾💪🏾
	3 of those 150s were vs ATL lol
	Myles Turner
	Has anyone seen a worst defense than the hawks?
	 😐
	Don't forget 4 blocks as well
