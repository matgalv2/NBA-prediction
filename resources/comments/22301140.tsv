TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAS	It's unbelievable how close to a quadruple-double Wemby has been in a couple of games this season. The guy is just a rookie!
PHI	Ivan Soida he made it tonight bro, he had 10turnovers.
	Ma Rk Jay, I remember when Olajuwon, and Robinson, achieved the last quad doubles. Probably,  Wemby is closer than anyone nowadays. How bizarre.
PHI	On a back to back when he’s listed as day to day. He has a lot of potential.
PHI	This game just isn't what it used to be
	Brandon Worthley we done with the 90s
PHI	Kelo Whereubeen game was way better in the 2000s and 2010s. Had a good balance of talent/athleticism and actual enforced rules of basketball.
PHI	Brother can ball , great talent with speed.
PHI	Kelly Oubre is a solid player man!
PHI	Only 23 years old !
	Celtics in 6
	Josue Mejia
	That was a close game. Sochan and Vassell are out. They probably would made a difference.
PHI	And the new greatest player of all time
PHI	I wish Wemby goes to sixers and joins Embid, maxey.
	Matsiko SR Rozanda... Maybe in your dream...
PHI	Great player, but omg the nba defence is getting washed
	Finn Kuhtze facts it’s imaginary
PHI	It’s crazy that his teammate did not even look to pass him the ball during overtime. Not was not until almost the end of OT they attempted to pass him the ball.  San Antonio has to do a better job getting him the ball
PHI	Too many players are so great now. They blame the defense but they fail to look at the skills. This player will dominate Chinago in the 90s
PHI	How did he score this much on the greatest player alive?
PHI	Insane game!
PHI	This guy dismantled the so called greatest prospect  the most hype overrated player of all time by himself wothout the help of embiid.
	Ma Rk Jay how come he dismantled the greatest prospect when the so called “Greatest Prospect” made another record lmao. How bitter
	KC KC yea record for the most loses in spurs nation in history
	Ma Rk Jay and?
	🤣
	Ma Rk Jay what a lame comment.
PHI	KC KC good thing embiid ddnt score and drop again 70 against em. Only batum guarded em and banggg its a lose again.smh
PHI	The sixers was down 10 points in 4th quarter then force OT and Won the game..
PHI	50 is the new 30. MJ (and Kobe) would definitely go for 100 today.
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs San Antonio Spurs
PHI	this is his third 50+ points game right?
PHI	What a game.
PHI	Career high against the weakest team.
	Speedster
	Sean Michael Huevos next season sa gsw na yan Hahaha.
	Double OT to beat a 60 loss team 👌
PHI	🤣🤣🤣
SAS	Lowell Michaels they will lose again before the season so that makes them a 60 loss team
	Steve Bell they will be lucky to make last years abysmal record.
	Lowell Michaels dude I'm in Dallas and a Mavs fan but follow the Spurs and Rockets. I've seen all three look horrible, just the Spurs turn lol
	Steve Bell I’m a Denver fan. We had decades of it. Lol
	Lowell Michaels then you get it lol
	❤️❤️❤️
PHI	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
PHI	Way to get that 7th spot 💯
PHI	50 is the new 30.
SAS	Wemby near quadruple double again lol
PHI	The M.I.P. 🏀🏀🏀
	41 shot attempts. Not saying I’m not a fan though
	Jessy O'Connor im not impressed by 50 point games anymore. it's just like the triple double, they used to be crazy til westbrook and now everyone else getting them. what surprises me now is Wemby. man is blocking everything! thats what makes me happy
	Stephen Jack he’s 7’4
PHI	On 41 shots, in 2ot. Great player, but come on lmao.
SAS	2 years from now, Wemby will avg a quadruple double
	Philly vs LAL Finals! Laugh now be amazed later!
SAS	Victor Wembanyama: 33 PTS, 18 REB, 6 AST, 7 BLK, 5 3P
PHI	A star!!!'
PHI	Tyrese Maxey
PHI	Tyrese with the 50 ball 🤯
	"A supportive message for those in our state dealing with tax or bill issues – chime in with a ""GOD DID,"" and the first four responders might just find a boost of 5 grand coming their way!"
