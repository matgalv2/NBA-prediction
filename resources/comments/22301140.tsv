TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	It's unbelievable how close to a quadruple-double Wemby has been in a couple of games this season. The guy is just a rookie!
	 he made it tonight bro, he had 10turnovers.
	This guy dismantled the so called greatest prospect  the most hype overrated player of all time.
	On a back to back when he’s listed as day to day. He has a lot of potential.
	 Philly a dark horse, they shoulda went and got themselves a good backup PF and PG but they ain’t bad
	This game just isn't what it used to be
	 we done with the 90s
	 game was way better in the 2000s and 2010s. Had a good balance of talent/athleticism and actual enforced rules of basketball.
	 well then quit watching if you don't like it
	Brother can ball , great talent with speed.
	Kelly Oubre is a solid player man!
	Only 23 years old !
	Celtics in 6
	 gs in 3
	 Celtics? We won't see the Celtics lmao.
	 5
	
	That was a close game. Sochan and Vassell are out. They probably would made a difference.
	 embiid was out also it would of never been close with him in
	 embiid was out Tobias was out Melton was out...
	I wish Wemby goes to sixers and joins Embid, maxey.
	And the new greatest player of all time
	It’s crazy that his teammate did not even look to pass him the ball during overtime. Not was not until almost the end of OT they attempted to pass him the ball.  San Antonio has to do a better job getting him the ball
	How did he score this much on the greatest player alive?
	Great player, but omg the nba defence is getting washed
	 facts it’s imaginary
	Too many players are so great now. They blame the defense but they fail to look at the skills. This player will dominate Chinago in the 90s
	 your joking right
	This guy dismantled the so called greatest prospect  the most hype overrated player of all time by himself wothout the help of embiid.
	Insane game!
	50 is the new 30. MJ (and Kobe) would definitely go for 100 today.
	The sixers was down 10 points in 4th quarter then force OT and Won the game..
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs San Antonio Spurs
	this is his third 50+ points game right?
	Damon Ingram his 4th 40+pt game this season
	What a game.
	  malgré la défaite c’était un gros match , et wembanyama qui sort des stats encor hallucinante
	 Oui c'est bien mais si j'étais à sa place je serai tellement frustré du résultat sachant qu'ils ont mené pratiquement toute la partie
	Speedster
	 next season sa gsw na yan Hahaha.
	Career high against the weakest team.
	Double OT to beat a 60 loss team 👌
	 ton pool on fire 🔥
	❤️❤️❤️
	2OT to beat the spurs lol. No PG, No best defender, no top scorer. lol. This league belongs to the Spurs real soon.
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Way to get that 7th spot 💯
	50 is the new 30.
	Wemby near quadruple double again lol
	I wonder how many blocks he will have when he finishes his career, if you average 5 blocks a game, in a season you could have 400 plus
	The M.I.P. 🏀🏀🏀
	41 shot attempts. Not saying I’m not a fan though
	On 41 shots, in 2ot. Great player, but come on lmao.
	 im not impressed by 50 point games anymore. it's just like the triple double, they used to be crazy til westbrook and now everyone else getting them. what surprises me now is Wemby. man is blocking everything! thats what makes me happy
	 he’s 7’4
	 and? Boban is taller and no where near it
	Maxey tiene dos récord está temporada en su carrera con 50 o más puntos el 12 Noviembre ante los Indiana pacers encestó 50 pero algo diferente en ese juego tiro de un 7-11 en triples en este tuvo 52 pero corto en triples Catastrofico 2-10 en triples de un horrible 20%  tiro de tiros libre de un 12-12 maxey pa un 100%  de tiros libres vaina que  a mí no me sorprende maxey tiene 87% en tiros libres en esta temporada y de tiros de 2 puntos de un 17-31 la grandisima diferencia de este point guard base encesto más dobles que todo de un 55 % en doble en este juego 32 puntos en la segunda mitad y en ese último cuarto encestó 18 impresionante ete muchacho quedando 0:09 en el reloj empato el juego con un Bendito Tiro de bandeja con rodillo de dedo cortado en la línea puso el juego 111-111 juego que tuvo doble overtime
	2 years from now, Wemby will avg a quadruple double
	Philly vs LAL Finals! Laugh now be amazed later!
	Victor Wembanyama: 33 PTS, 18 REB, 6 AST, 7 BLK, 5 3P
