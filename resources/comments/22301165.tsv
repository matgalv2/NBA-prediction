TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	KD and Booker had to play 40 minutes against Clippers G League 🤣 😭  I ❤️💙it. Go Clippers
	Joe Brown exactly
	Beat their D team 😂
	Hallelujah, thanks Booker and the rest of our Suns for beating the Clippers
	Clippers gave them that game.
	Reggie Demmons same thought
	Jun E. Calimlim same here
	Phoenix Suns Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	The suns beat a team that played their bench warmers at full strength by only 16. So...
	The Suns brought their roster printed on gold foil, while the other team showed up with a lineup scribbled on the back of a napkin! Talk about bringing a crayon to a pen fight!
	And they struggled the whole game 😂😂😂
	I’m a Suns fan and that was anything but a masterpiece
	Y’all happy asl that suns beat players that never get in the game 😂😂😂
	Brandon Rankin Suns definitely didn’t play great but I honestly don’t understand how people who claim to watch basketball are surprised by these scenarios. Every guy in the NBA is a professional and capable of going off. I’d argue the guys that never see floor time are more motivated and play harder. It’s not that crazy lol. Win is a win at this point in the season and how the game was played and point differential literally doesn’t matter.
	Jennifer Smith first round exit is what matter lol
	😁
	Jennifer Smith I can tell you what my eyes see though
	😆
	🤣
	Suns super team vs clips 3rd team 🤣
	Good job took them back out at there home town
	Mitchell WRd bench clippers player
	Baltazar Carlos I  almost went to this game but I stayed
	Mitchell WRd cheap and they we watch them
	Struggled to handle the clippers C squad
	Against the clippers bench
	Because Suns won, the Lakers and Warriors secured their spots in the play in tournament. Congratulations 🫡
	vs lac bench players😂😂😂
	Jai Joseph Rubin chapot man pre
	😂😂
	This dude is an all time great one day and the next day he's JR Smith.. so inconsistent
	Against bunch of bench players LOL
	Give away from clips.. Should have thank them.. 😂 😂 😂
	Great comeback Suns.🏀
	None of the stars from Clippers played
	The Suns really waited for Nuggets vs Wolves final score before taking the Clippers seriously lmao they knew they matchup well against Minnesota.
	Benedict John Soriano Cadawas they would likely face the OKC at 3
	guy went 0-9 last game no ? I mean, every dog has it's day.
	Gab Fig 1 for 11
	😂
	Perfect for the Mavs 🙃
	Patrick Eder how perfect of the mavs explain
	😁
	Patrick Eder no 1 win by the clippers secure in thev4 spot in the standing
	Patrick Eder mavs need to win 2 games in the last 2 games but clippers need to win 1 game to last to 2 games... if clippers and mavs tie standing clippers win dvsion ranking
	☹️ i am optimistic 😜 didn’t know that…
	Patrick Eder its okay now you know...
	Patrick Eder the clippers last 2 matchup vs jazz and rockets... 
	Lol we can beat them and they know it, Go clips 😁
	Good job son - Luka 😆
	Against 3rd stringers 🤔
	Clippers played one rotation player in the second half n that was Coffey 😂😂😂
	They needed that win.
	Problem with the sun's is they focus too much on their starters, their bench isn't dependable and that deep!
	This guy lacks defense.
	MID at best
	Good Win Go Suns
	#24-#8🙏
	Y’all uploaded them highlights quick asl.. but ain’t even wanna post the beat down they got last game 😂
	Wouldn’t call that a masterpiece. They played out G league team and almost lost. Literally. Clippers ran out of juice after practically playing the entire game. Guys that don’t even play. Don’t understand Ty Lou’s strategy. Bones was practically collapsing. It was as if Ty Lou wanted to lose.
	Imagine hiring a new coach and trading for KD and Bradley Beal just to have a hard time beating an Ontario Clippers team led by Bones Hyland 😩😭💀🤣
	Still a jurk
	What a joke .. Clippers played no starters and this is a masterpiece ??? 😂.. bones hyland had a better game .. suns are a play in exit !!! Durant to the Celtics next year
	The NBA should not allow teams to rest all their starters as it can, in this case, appear they are assisting their opposing team to secure their playoff position. This is worth investigating especially since this has ramifications for the entire league. The warriors and lakers both had a shot at the 6th seed until the suns beat a bench team. There was no way the suns win with Kwahi and team playing.
	The clippers benched everybody.  “Masterpiece” is a bold choice of words.
	Denver still winning the whole thing again..
	Masterpiece?  Idk about all that...
	suns about to get the 6th seed to face the babies in OKC and a guaranteed west semis trip.
	La vs gsw even win vs kings
	Suns had a masterpiece win against Kobe Brownt  and Athletic Mason Plumber.
	Whatever you say, a Win is a Win! Let’s go Suns🔥☄️
	Bones Hyland 👏❤️💙
	Hyland's 37pt 9ast 4Reb 
	Free win game- thanks to the Clippers
	Durant need help😂
	lmao dominate against clippers bench 🤣 this phoenix suns team won't go anywhere this season 😂🤣 #FirstRoundExit
	Pretty lame considering who they played.
	Needed that win ☄️☄️☄️
	Got there revenge though.
	For Bones to give y’all 37 is wild 😂😂
	Raymond, the real masterpiece in that game.
	The best.
	Oh!!!! ......how the turns table 😊😊😊
	Michelle Perdomo You realize they didn’t have their 4 star players on the court right ?😂 They’ve clinched the playoffs regardless, they don’t care😂😂
	🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Devin Booker is a master
	That was a easy game
	no body played 4 la suns  are  weak.
	Good job Dbooker!!ur smile amazing🥰
	mASteRpIeCe
	Bounce Back Clippers 😭
	Booker is funny
	They beat PJ tucker
	Nice one Clippers 😂😂
	You should beat the Cippers B team.
	In Los Angeles there is only one basketball team, the other one is just a failure.💛💜

	Booker good,When he wanna be
	Bench players or not people gotta understand these are nba players.. they’re in the nba for a reason 😑  nevertheless most embarrassing win of the season
	I love that picture of you and God bless you!!! 🙏😇
	lol they couldn’t do that 💩 against the pelicans 😂
	Weren't they down by alot
	Surely they will lose in the playoffs
	Phoenix 1st round exit
	and cry baby Booker wins againts Clippers Bench
	Bench players vs starters 🤣🤣 clippers still better though
	Zach Kline
	Yuri Neil Mones
	👀 🦴🧑‍🍳
	🤣
	If I'm the Suns, I wouldn't feel confident about this win. It was against the bench and it took KD, Beal, and Booker all playing over 30 minutes and all scoring over 20pts to win this game. Only one of them had to have a bad game and they would have lost.
	Michael Vance I am a Suns fan and I wasn't that happy win is a win but 3 superstars to struggle that bad vs the BENCH OF THE CLIPPERS shouldn't happen, gotta do better
	Brad Mangold Suns have too much talent to be a play-in team. Not only do they have the talent, but they have experience as well. Nearly everyone on that roster has been in the playoffs and played in big games, but they still look like they are trying to figure it out. It does them no favors that the Warriors and Lakers are getting hot at the right time. They need to try to steal the 6th seed from the Pelicans or hope they get the matchup with the Kings. I really hope they can get it together because I think that when everyone is clicking, they could beat anyone in a 7 game series.
	Now, did the suns beat both Minnesota and the Nuggets a week ago? Just Kat and Murray were missing for those games and the suns beat them pretty handily. just sayin
	❤️❤️❤️
	The Clippers 2nd Stringers put up a good fight. 🥊
	Clippers was avoiding the Mavs at 1st round
	Nba is so rigged🤐
	Devin Booker
	About time
