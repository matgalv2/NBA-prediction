	KD and Booker had to play 40 minutes against Clippers G League 🤣 😭  I ❤️💙it. Go Clippers
	 exactly
	Hallelujah, thanks Booker and the rest of our Suns for beating the Clippers
	Clippers gave them that game.
	 same thought
	 same here
	Beat their D team 😂
	Phoenix Suns Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	The suns beat a team that played their bench warmers at full strength by only 16. So...
	The Suns brought their roster printed on gold foil, while the other team showed up with a lineup scribbled on the back of a napkin! Talk about bringing a crayon to a pen fight!
	And they struggled the whole game 😂😂😂
	Y’all happy asl that suns beat players that never get in the game 😂😂😂
	I’m a Suns fan and that was anything but a masterpiece
	Suns super team vs clips 3rd team 🤣
	vs lac bench players😂😂😂
	Struggled to handle the clippers C squad
	Good job took them back out at there home town
	Against the clippers bench
	Give away from clips.. Should have thank them.. 😂 😂 😂
	Great comeback Suns.🏀
	Because Suns won, the Lakers and Warriors secured their spots in the play in tournament. Congratulations 🫡
	This dude is an all time great one day and the next day he's JR Smith.. so inconsistent
	The Suns really waited for Nuggets vs Wolves final score before taking the Clippers seriously lmao they knew they matchup well against Minnesota.
	Against bunch of bench players LOL
	None of the stars from Clippers played
	Good job son - Luka 😆
	Perfect for the Mavs 🙃
	Against 3rd stringers 🤔
	guy went 0-9 last game no ? I mean, every dog has it's day.
	Lol we can beat them and they know it, Go clips 😁
	Clippers played one rotation player in the second half n that was Coffey 😂😂😂
	They needed that win.
	This guy lacks defense.
	Problem with the sun's is they focus too much on their starters, their bench isn't dependable and that deep!
	MID at best
	Good Win Go Suns
	#24-#8🙏
	Y’all uploaded them highlights quick asl.. but ain’t even wanna post the beat down they got last game 😂
	"Wouldn’t call that a masterpiece. They played out G league team and almost lost. Literally. Clippers ran out of juice after practically playing the entire game. Guys that don’t even play. Don’t understand Ty Lou’s strategy. Bones was practically collap… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	Still a jurk
	Imagine hiring a new coach and trading for KD and Bradley Beal just to have a hard time beating an Ontario Clippers team led by Bones Hyland 😩😭💀🤣
	What a joke .. Clippers played no starters and this is a masterpiece ??? 😂.. bones hyland had a better game .. suns are a play in exit !!! Durant to the Celtics next year
	"The  should not allow teams to rest all their starters as it can, in this case, appear they are assisting their opposing team to secure their playoff position. This is worth investigating especially since this has ramifications for the entire league… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	The clippers benched everybody.  “Masterpiece” is a bold choice of words.
	Masterpiece?  Idk about all that...
	Denver still winning the whole thing again..
	La vs gsw even win vs kings
	suns about to get the 6th seed to face the babies in OKC and a guaranteed west semis trip.
	Bones Hyland 👏❤️💙
	Suns had a masterpiece win against Kobe Brownt  and Athletic Mason Plumber.
	Whatever you say, a Win is a Win! Let’s go Suns🔥☄️
	Hyland's 37pt 9ast 4Reb 
	Durant need help😂
	lmao dominate against clippers bench 🤣 this phoenix suns team won't go anywhere this season 😂🤣 
	Pretty lame considering who they played.
	Needed that win ☄️☄️☄️
	Got there revenge though.
	For Bones to give y’all 37 is wild 😂😂
	The best.
	Oh!!!! ......how the turns table 😊😊😊
	Devin Booker is a master
	That was a easy game
	no body played 4 la suns  are  weak.
	Good job Dbooker!!ur smile amazing🥰
	mASteRpIeCe
	Bounce Back Clippers 😭
	Booker is funny
	They beat PJ tucker
	Nice one Clippers 😂😂
	You should beat the Cippers B team.
	In Los Angeles there is only one basketball team, the other one is just a failure.💛💜
	Booker good,When he wanna be
	Bench players or not people gotta understand these are nba players.. they’re in the nba for a reason 😑  nevertheless most embarrassing win of the season
	I love that picture of you and God bless you!!! 🙏😇
	lol they couldn’t do that 💩 against the pelicans 😂
	Weren't they down by alot
	Surely they will lose in the playoffs
	Phoenix 1st round exit
	and cry baby Booker wins againts Clippers Bench
	Bench players vs starters 🤣🤣 clippers still better though
	
	
	👀 🦴🧑‍🍳
	🤣
	If I'm the Suns, I wouldn't feel confident about this win. It was against the bench and it took KD, Beal, and Booker all playing over 30 minutes and all scoring over 20pts to win this game. Only one of them had to have a bad game and they would have lost.
	Now, did the suns beat both Minnesota and the Nuggets a week ago? Just Kat and Murray were missing for those games and the suns beat them pretty handily. just sayin
	❤️❤️❤️
	The Clippers 2nd Stringers put up a good fight. 🥊
	Clippers was avoiding the Mavs at 1st round
	Nba is so rigged🤐
	Devin Booker
	About time
	
	Thank You Clippers!
	loveu dbook
