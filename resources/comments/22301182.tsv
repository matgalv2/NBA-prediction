	Whatever happens, Lakers will be the champion.
	Thank you New Orleans Pelicans for such a fine, fine day so far! Lakers won and the GSW Pretenders lost! 😅🙌👏🫶❤️👌
	Well played CJ!
	Cj played amazing. Really incredible. And it was a good game to watch. Dubs tried to rally, just came up short.
	Lakers won, Kings and Warriors lost.
	As a lakers fan thank you so much Pelicans and Suns 😂💜💛
	 I’m looking forward for the Lakers to get Swept again !
	 I'm looking forward for the Warriors to the BORACAY again😂😂😂
	 I'm looking forward for the Warriors to the kangkongan again😂😂😂
	Steph curry = Best side kick of all time! 💯 ❤️
	You need to double/triple guard the good shooters like they do with curry, Warriors lacking defense! I’m still a Warrior fan😘🙏❤️
	No worries. The way GS played the entire game without the second quarter gives me the vibe for the 8th spot.
	thank you pelicans your a great shooter than curry sidekick but lakers will destroy you in the last game
	Pels are a great team when all their main pieces are playing ball
	Thank you Pelicans and Suns 😁
	Well played.
	The Warriors only had one job and they failed
	Warriors gave up too many threes and turnovers nice win for New Orleans
	Thank you PHX AND NOP...LA for now has the sole possession of the 8th seed 🤣....and see u NOP 2 times🤗
	Used up his shooting, so nothing in the take for next game. Smart
	LAKERS WON, KINGS &amp; WARRIORS LOST. 
	Lakers need to win the last game.They need to play Defense and not give up to many 3's .The other players need to step up this game
	pro nga2x to sa lakers haha.. 3-1 against them..welcome to 4-1 NOP haha..
	Warriors will win this year believe me
	They made it to the playoffs becoz zion is healthy
	It was a very good day, kings lost, then gsw lost, then lakers won😄😃😜😝
	CJ and Zion will not play vs the Lakers on Monday - rest
	GSW just isn’t as tough as the other teams in the league.
	Lakers Win, warriors lose what a great day😆🤭
	Thank you CJ. My Lakers appreciate the win. 😂
	Gonna need a win and the Suns to beat the t wolves to avoid having Denver in the first round..
	purok 10 very well deserved 😭😭😭😭
	. Pelican played well this year in general , as long as those big two keep healthy,  the other team mates  around them will play better.
	What a great day, Lakers won, GSW lose 🤣
	If Denver ends up the 3rd seed, Pels in 7. 
	Lakers better help us now!!! Only time I will be rooting for the Lakers as a Suns fan!
	The Warriors lack of defence in the 2nd quarter has coz them a lot...
	And tomorrow is another day for 46-36 even with the warriors and kings😁
	Warriors 10th spot. Lakers 8th
	Good game they played great but warriors gave  the game away with turnovers but that doesn’t take away how good these guys play fr
	Chris went to the warriors to win a ring
	8th place scenario for WC.
	Lakers are gonna get swept again 🥺
	Everyone is losing in purpose now so that they can face the easy Lakers in the Play-In... The Kings did it yesterday because they know Sabonis owns Davis. And now the Warriors intentionally losing because Curry owns LeBron in the Finals 3-1.
	I’ll bet him to hit 3 rn and put him in a slump don’t play w me mannn
	Welldonw suns and pelicans all for helping la to save 8seed 😂
	Zion and Jose ignite the fire the others need to play hard and it is showing.
	Another Heartbreaking day to GSW Fandumbnation 🤣🤣🤣
	Laker's for the win.. Golden state for the lose..what a day 🤣🤣🤣
	The Anatomy of Inconsistency of the Dubs put them.once again on the tail end of the play in....🙄
	What a great beautiful day 😂
	What a good day!
