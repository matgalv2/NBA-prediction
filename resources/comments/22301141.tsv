	Imagine he plays all 82 games in a season and has 82 streak double double, that record would be impossible to beat
	
	 unfortunately he won’t 😭 I think the most he will get will be like 77? I think lol but that would be dope 💯
	 did wilt not do that?
	 no, the previous consecutive double double record was held by Kevin Love if not mistaken, which was 50 plus
	 he did 227 double double
	 yes Wilt had a streak of 81 games in 1966-1967 season. Sabonis is the longest since the merger.
	 This record is after the NBA-ABA merger. Wilt has the three places on the history podium, with 227 consecutive matches, 220 and 133.
	 wilt did it before the merger when there was about 8 total teams and no good players
	 jokic will do that in the next couple of years
	 wilt has has the record with 227 in a row 😳
	West play in is gonna be good
	 just unfortunate they got 2 key players injured at the wrong time
	 Yes he's a good player
	Wish OKC still had him
	 Then they wouldn't have Shai.
	 missing piece ng okc.. sna kunin nla ulit
	 Hi awesome
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	 I'm not a LeBron fan but your opinion is highly fabricated.
	Jonel Campuso Lebron literally put up 22p 20r 7a against the grizzlies in the playoffs last year
	 you mean the all time leading scorer? I'm a kings fan but cmon🤣
	 yeah. This is a bit much. Lol
	 this man didn't do to well in playoffs last year when it counted  everyone seems to have forgotten.
	Jonel Campuso luckily it’s just your worthless opinion😹😹😹😘😘
	 taaangaa mo talagang bob* ka, malapit kana mamat*y kasama pamilya mo
	 lol what drugs you on?
	 Hi awesome
	 you do know Lebron had 36 points 20 rebounds and 12 assists against the warriors right
	 8 Final Consecutive🤏🧠
	 how many rings they have?🤣
	 Lebron is pulling stats in loses totally different job 😂
	 wehhh?????? ..
	 He must have NBA  champs ring first.
	Congratulations to Sabonis and Kings team on the victory
	Wish his father could have played longer.  He was a giant with point guard passing skills from the post.
