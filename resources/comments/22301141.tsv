	Imagine he plays all 82 games in a season and has 82 streak double double, that record would be impossible to beat

	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Congratulations to Sabonis and Kings team on the victory
	Wish his father could have played longer.  He was a giant with point guard passing skills from the post.
