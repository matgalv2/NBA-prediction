TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Luka should not be in top 10 MVP let alone top 5.
	Better than Luka. Luka is European Russell Westbrook.
	Serkan Karatepe nah.
	Serkan Karatepe Luka had an off night and still almost had 40 with a triple double
	Josh Woodson but didn't win.
	Josh Woodson Luka is ballhogger
	Carlo Dy I'm a pacers fan.  Luka is averaging a triple double lately.   He doesn't have a great team behind him.  Mostly Kyrie.  Pacers have a good mix of players.
	Josh Woodson sometimes stats can't help a team to win....
	Josh Woodson Mavs plays more on iso. No much team work or lack of ball movement. His team mates only waiting for kyrie and luka assist... And most of their play only Luka or kyrie holds the ball.
	Josh Woodson Luka needs his team mates involve always on the play. They are great team. If u watch the 2021 playoffs Mavs without Luka from game 1-3 against  the no.2 jazz. The Mavs beat the jazz 2-1.
	Serkan Karatepe  you must be a special kind of stupid.
	🤡
	Mavs have one good game then boom lose the next few .. front line needs help
	Congrats pacers .. get winner in the game .. good job team, tyrese haliburton ♥
	Mavs out the playoffs
	Amro Abdulhafeez i’m affraid you are right.
	Tyrese Haliburton
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling absolutely
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
	Pacers always seem to play better against better competition. Beat Mavs but lose to Spurs and Raptors lol
	You will see more higher results of the games nowadays. Defense is not a thing anymore.
	Ty also had 1 block.
	Refs were cooking for the pacers this game 🔥😮‍💨
	Escanor Sin Now that’s hilarious!
	Seems you missed the 39 points tripple double from Luka…
	The Pacers fans been sad since 2005 when miller left I'm happy for them.
	Mavs mines well tank the rest of the season n try n get a good draft pick
	Mavs can’t afford to lose anymore or they might catch themself in the play in tournament smh
	Tyrese get Indiana win
	j.kidd vs mavs
	Cool
	Dallas is going to miss the playoffs again
	Definitely a strong player, but he seems a bit overrated to me
	Dallas need to trade one of the guys that takes 30 shots a game... Either one will do
	Scott Palmer they need to fire the coaching stuff.
	Indiana Pacers Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling so what's your favourite sports team??
	LeBron James the GOAT💪💪💪
	Looks like You missed the 39 point triple double from Luka 🤣🤣🤣
	Jake Isaacs looks like you missed the L he took.
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović novi poraz Dallasa, bit će vjerovatno u PI a ne u PO..
