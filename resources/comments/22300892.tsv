TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DAL	Luka should not be in top 10 MVP let alone top 5.
IND	Better than Luka. Luka is European Russell Westbrook.
	Serkan Karatepe nah.
DAL	Serkan Karatepe Luka had an off night and still almost had 40 with a triple double
DAL	Josh Woodson but didn't win.
DAL	Josh Woodson Luka is ballhogger
IND	Carlo Dy I'm a pacers fan.  Luka is averaging a triple double lately.   He doesn't have a great team behind him.  Mostly Kyrie.  Pacers have a good mix of players.
DAL	Josh Woodson sometimes stats can't help a team to win....
DAL	Josh Woodson Mavs plays more on iso. No much team work or lack of ball movement. His team mates only waiting for kyrie and luka assist... And most of their play only Luka or kyrie holds the ball.
DAL	Josh Woodson Luka needs his team mates involve always on the play. They are great team. If u watch the 2021 playoffs Mavs without Luka from game 1-3 against  the no.2 jazz. The Mavs beat the jazz 2-1.
	Serkan Karatepe  you must be a special kind of stupid.
	🤡
DAL	Mavs have one good game then boom lose the next few .. front line needs help
IND	Congrats pacers .. get winner in the game .. good job team, tyrese haliburton ♥
DAL	Mavs out the playoffs
DAL	Amro Abdulhafeez i’m affraid you are right.
IND	Tyrese Haliburton
IND	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling absolutely
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
IND	Pacers always seem to play better against better competition. Beat Mavs but lose to Spurs and Raptors lol
	You will see more higher results of the games nowadays. Defense is not a thing anymore.
IND	Ty also had 1 block.
	Refs were cooking for the pacers this game 🔥😮‍💨
	Escanor Sin Now that’s hilarious!
DAL	Seems you missed the 39 points tripple double from Luka…
IND	The Pacers fans been sad since 2005 when miller left I'm happy for them.
DAL	Mavs mines well tank the rest of the season n try n get a good draft pick
DAL	Mavs can’t afford to lose anymore or they might catch themself in the play in tournament smh
IND	Tyrese get Indiana win
	j.kidd vs mavs
	Cool
DAL	Dallas is going to miss the playoffs again
IND	Definitely a strong player, but he seems a bit overrated to me
DAL	Dallas need to trade one of the guys that takes 30 shots a game... Either one will do
DAL	Scott Palmer they need to fire the coaching stuff.
	Indiana Pacers Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling so what's your favourite sports team??
	LeBron James the GOAT💪💪💪
