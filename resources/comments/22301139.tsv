TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
NYK	This brother deserves more consideration for his balling. Much love little brother.
NYK	Jalen Brunson put the Knicks on his back
NYK	So happy for him to get out of the Mavericks team
MIL	Dame and Giannis only looks good on paper ￼
MIL	🤣🤣🤣
	Iceberg Dee unstoppable in 2k lol
	David Alexander facts with Beasley shooting threes Middleton is nice and brook Lopez blocking shots too
NYK	That Was A Much Needed Win
NYK	I mean yeah he went off, but who’s going to went off if it’s not him on that team 😂
NYK	good job jaebae
MIL	Bucks trying to avoid sixers or heat in the first round. They doing their best to get the 4rth seed😅
	Dulnuan Dan Rodel they need to get third or the Celtics is sending the home round 2
	😅
MIL	Bucks was a good team but needs to get it back together
MIL	Doc Rivers about to get fired again.
NYK	Big Mitch is back! He had a great game 🤜🏿. Jalen is our hero! HUGE win boys!!!
NYK	Congratulations Knicks ( even without their star Julius Randle )
NYK	For me his top 5 mvp of the league this year
NYK	The fact he's not atleast minimum top 5 in MVP contention is upsetting cuz dude is killing it, with an injured roster night after night. Heavy mins too
MIL	If the Bucks want to make it out of the first round of the playoffs, they should probably fire Doc Rivers tonight... dude is the touch of death to good teams
MIL	Fire Doc Rivers, shame for the Bucks putting him in.
MIL	Just win at least 3 more… as long as they have a better winning season than Miami…I’m good.
NYK	All NBA 2nd team locked up.
NYK	"This guy will be ""Allen Iverson Jr."" someday if he plays consistantly, for reall, Go Brunsonnn!!!"
MIL	Bucks in trouble..... might get bounced in the first round pending who they play
NYK	Great news....
NYK	Good team effort by the Knicks. Shoutouts to Hartenstein for that dive to the ball.
MIL	Doc is on a mission  to dismantle this team i tell u!!
MIL	Bucks dont want Heat
MIL	Bucks are avoiding the Heat. Hahaha
NYK	only average player...show more....🤟🤟🤟
NYK	Should be called New York Brunson
MIL	Bucks first round exit
	New York Knicks Vs Milwaukee Bucks
NYK	Brunson been going off! MVP!
MIL	What happen to milwaukee ? 🥲🥲🥲
NYK	He is him
MIL	Are they trying to avoid Miami Heat ?🤣🤣🤣
MIL	Bucks gonna get eliminated first round.
NYK	Kitchen sink for the pivotal W. This team has grit! Superstar of the East MVP of the League dominates the front court, allowing his teammates to fight for every possession and show the bucks who’s Boss. This was accomplished by another amazing showing by Big/Little Hart taking over the middle from the bucks own twin towers. OG return was a menace to the bucks offensive game plan in the 2nd half. He neutralized the biggest threats Portis Middleton. The Big Ragu held bucks back with sharp shooting. BB kept the game close in the first half when it looked bleak for the Knicks. This was the biggest win of the year. An L here would have put into question our playoff chances beyond an appearance of success. We can now focus on a strong finish and build on Mitchs comeback in the final stretch. If this game is the true Knicks character, no team is safe near or far. 🏀 💪
	It sucks so bad that Randle is done for the year. That bench was so deep with him in the lineup. I'm concerned about the health of OG come playoff time. Maybe they can get to the ECF.
MIL	more losses bucks! we need you to clinch the 3rd spot and face pacers in the 1st round of the playoffs!
MIL	The bucks are in trouble. That trade &amp; replacing the coach was not as good as they thought it would be.
NYK	They said we should fear the Bucks since they got Dame 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
MIL	Come on, Doc
	Bojan 15 in 17 min., again. Good that he doesn't play 30 min. games wouldn't be interesting🤣
MIL	Giannis getting the hell out of Milwaukee ASAP.
NYK	Why is this guy not in the MVP conversation?
MIL	Why did Giannis fire Adrian griffin again? Giannis has his yes sir no sir coach. It doesn’t work
MIL	What record did the Bucks have under the previous coach? 🤔
MIL	What a shame!! 😭
MIL	🖋️ Doc Rivers retired
	Mike Gaines witness and doesn’t need a super team
NYK	Keep on winning Knicks
NYK	Jalen Brunson beat the Bucks
MIL	Did dame play?
	Let Thanasis play.
MIL	The guy Dame hates to see !
NYK	NY vs Dallas shesssss
MIL	Everyone is beating the Bucks right now
NYK	We needed that 💪💯
NYK	He do what he gotta do ✅
	This data looks good.
MIL	I told y'all. Bucks are the Clippers of the East, and none of y'all don't care.
	Ivan Sanchez Orbe ?? Clippers dont have champ!! You compare them to the one who sweep the miami
MIL	CaiRel MarTy I'm talking about Doc Rivers being the coach for the Bucks.
NYK	This guy has been sensational this season
	Bring back bud
NYK	Great job 👏🏾
