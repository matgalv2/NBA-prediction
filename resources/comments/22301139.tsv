	This brother deserves more consideration for his balling. Much love little brother.
	 MPV
	 Definitely gives it his all every night.
	Jalen Brunson put the Knicks on his back
	 how are you doing?Good morning
	Dame and Giannis only looks good on paper ￼
	 man theyre avoiding heat or else first round exit again
	 and 2k🤣🤣🤣
	 Maybe the Bucks need a NEW DOC!! Maybe this time Giannis will call for Thannis to coach
	So happy for him to get out of the Mavericks team 
	 sorry but irving &gt; Brunson any day. 
	 good morning dear
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	 u drunk never type this again in ur life
	 Nagpapapansin oh! Pansinin niyo naman
	 huh? 🤣
	kahit saan nalang ganyan comment mo, hahaha solid haters lodi? Hahaha kung sa stats lang malayo pa mga idol mong bobo ka mamatay kana pati pamilya mo
	 kwento. Mo Yan
	Jonel Campuso oh yea you definitely need to go take a drug test 😱🧐
	Jonel Campuso I have my criticisms abt Lebron, but this was all he did in his career—especially in his Cleveland days. Dude earned being the all-around best
	  ok sabi mo eh
	  Lebron is the NBA  highest scorer he doesn’t need to be compared to anyone
	 good win for The Knicks definitely needs this win  they  basically control their own destiny with the standings I still feel OG should sit but they seem like they control he's minutes
	 bron only chasing points,,flopping,turnovers,complainings,walkout,fake injuries,etc etc
	taaangaa mo talagang bob* ka, malapit kana mamat*y kasama pamilya mo
	That Was A Much Needed Win
	I mean yeah he went off, but who’s going to went off if it’s not him on that team 😂
	 donte cold
	good job jaebae
	Bucks trying to avoid sixers or heat in the first round. They doing their best to get the 4rth seed😅
	 they need to get third or the Celtics is sending the home round 2
	Bucks was a good team but needs to get it back together
	Doc Rivers about to get fired again.
	 and rehired
	 why
	Big Mitch is back! He had a great game 🤜🏿. Jalen is our hero! HUGE win boys!!!
	The fact he's not atleast minimum top 5 in MVP contention is upsetting cuz dude is killing it, with an injured roster night after night. Heavy mins too
	Congratulations Knicks ( even without their star Julius Randle )
	For me his top 5 mvp of the league this year
	Fire Doc Rivers, shame for the Bucks putting him in.
	"This guy will be ""Allen Iverson Jr."" someday if he plays consistantly, for reall, Go Brunsonnn!!!"
	Doc is on a mission  to dismantle this team i tell u!!
	Great news....
	Just win at least 3 more… as long as they have a better winning season than Miami…I’m good.
	All NBA 2nd team locked up.
	If the Bucks want to make it out of the first round of the playoffs, they should probably fire Doc Rivers tonight... dude is the touch of death to good teams
	Bucks in trouble..... might get bounced in the first round pending who they play
	Bucks dont want Heat
	only average player...show more....🤟🤟🤟
	Good team effort by the Knicks. Shoutouts to Hartenstein for that dive to the ball.
	New York Knicks Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	Should be called New York Brunson
	Bucks first round exit
	Bucks are avoiding the Heat. Hahaha
	Brunson been going off! MVP!
	What happen to milwaukee ? 🥲🥲🥲
	Are they trying to avoid  ?🤣🤣🤣
	He is him
	The Doc Rivers effect is real
	Bucks gonna get eliminated first round.
	It sucks so bad that Randle is done for the year. That bench was so deep with him in the lineup. I'm concerned about the health of OG come playoff time. Maybe they can get to the ECF.
	Kitchen sink for the pivotal W. This team has grit! Superstar of the East MVP of the League dominates the front court, allowing his teammates to fight for every possession and show the bucks who’s Boss. This was accomplished by another amazing showing <a tabindex= 💪
	more losses bucks! we need you to clinch the 3rd spot and face pacers in the 1st round of the playoffs!
	The bucks are in trouble. That trade &amp; replacing the coach was not as good as they thought it would be.
	They said we should fear the Bucks since they got Dame 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Giannis getting the hell out of Milwaukee ASAP.
	What record did the Bucks have under the previous coach? 🤔
	Bojan 15 in 17 min., again. Good that he doesn't play 30 min. games wouldn't be interesting🤣
	Why is this guy not in the MVP conversation?
	Come on, Doc
	Why did Giannis fire Adrian griffin again? Giannis has his yes sir no sir coach. It doesn’t work
	What a shame!! 😭
	🖋️ Doc Rivers retired
	 witness and doesn’t need a super team
	Keep on winning Knicks
	Jalen Brunson beat the Bucks
	Did dame play?
	Let Thanasis play.
	The guy Dame hates to see !
	NY vs Dallas shesssss
	Everyone is beating the Bucks right now
	We needed that 💪💯
	He do what he gotta do ✅
	This data looks good.
	I told y'all. Bucks are the Clippers of the East, and none of y'all don't care.
	This guy has been sensational this season
	Mag pinsan cguro to c doc rivers at chot reyes ??🤔😅✌
