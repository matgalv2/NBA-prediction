TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	This brother deserves more consideration for his balling. Much love little brother.
	Jalen Brunson put the Knicks on his back
	So happy for him to get out of the Mavericks team 
	Dame and Giannis only looks good on paper ￼
	🤣🤣🤣
	Iceberg Dee unstoppable in 2k lol
	David Alexander facts with Beasley shooting threes Middleton is nice and brook Lopez blocking shots too
	That Was A Much Needed Win
	I mean yeah he went off, but who’s going to went off if it’s not him on that team 😂
	good job jaebae
	Bucks trying to avoid sixers or heat in the first round. They doing their best to get the 4rth seed😅
	Dulnuan Dan Rodel they need to get third or the Celtics is sending the home round 2
	😅
	Bucks was a good team but needs to get it back together
	Doc Rivers about to get fired again.
	Big Mitch is back! He had a great game 🤜🏿. Jalen is our hero! HUGE win boys!!!
	Congratulations Knicks ( even without their star Julius Randle )
	For me his top 5 mvp of the league this year
	The fact he's not atleast minimum top 5 in MVP contention is upsetting cuz dude is killing it, with an injured roster night after night. Heavy mins too
	If the Bucks want to make it out of the first round of the playoffs, they should probably fire Doc Rivers tonight... dude is the touch of death to good teams
	Fire Doc Rivers, shame for the Bucks putting him in.
	Just win at least 3 more… as long as they have a better winning season than Miami…I’m good.
	All NBA 2nd team locked up.
	"This guy will be ""Allen Iverson Jr."" someday if he plays consistantly, for reall, Go Brunsonnn!!!"
	Bucks in trouble..... might get bounced in the first round pending who they play
	Great news....
	Good team effort by the Knicks. Shoutouts to Hartenstein for that dive to the ball.
	Doc is on a mission  to dismantle this team i tell u!!
	Bucks dont want Heat
	Bucks are avoiding the Heat. Hahaha
	only average player...show more....🤟🤟🤟
	Should be called New York Brunson
	Bucks first round exit
	New York Knicks Vs Milwaukee Bucks
	Brunson been going off! MVP!
	What happen to milwaukee ? 🥲🥲🥲
	He is him
	Are they trying to avoid Miami Heat ?🤣🤣🤣
	Bucks gonna get eliminated first round.
	Kitchen sink for the pivotal W. This team has grit! Superstar of the East MVP of the League dominates the front court, allowing his teammates to fight for every possession and show the bucks who’s Boss. This was accomplished by another amazing showing by Big/Little Hart taking over the middle from the bucks own twin towers. OG return was a menace to the bucks offensive game plan in the 2nd half. He neutralized the biggest threats Portis Middleton. The Big Ragu held bucks back with sharp shooting. BB kept the game close in the first half when it looked bleak for the Knicks. This was the biggest win of the year. An L here would have put into question our playoff chances beyond an appearance of success. We can now focus on a strong finish and build on Mitchs comeback in the final stretch. If this game is the true Knicks character, no team is safe near or far. 🏀 💪
	It sucks so bad that Randle is done for the year. That bench was so deep with him in the lineup. I'm concerned about the health of OG come playoff time. Maybe they can get to the ECF.
	more losses bucks! we need you to clinch the 3rd spot and face pacers in the 1st round of the playoffs!
	The bucks are in trouble. That trade &amp; replacing the coach was not as good as they thought it would be.
	They said we should fear the Bucks since they got Dame 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Come on, Doc
	Bojan 15 in 17 min., again. Good that he doesn't play 30 min. games wouldn't be interesting🤣
	Giannis getting the hell out of Milwaukee ASAP.
	Why is this guy not in the MVP conversation?
	Why did Giannis fire Adrian griffin again? Giannis has his yes sir no sir coach. It doesn’t work
	What record did the Bucks have under the previous coach? 🤔
	What a shame!! 😭
	🖋️ Doc Rivers retired
	Mike Gaines witness and doesn’t need a super team
	Keep on winning Knicks
	Jalen Brunson beat the Bucks
	Did dame play?
	Let Thanasis play.
	The guy Dame hates to see !
	NY vs Dallas shesssss
	Everyone is beating the Bucks right now
	We needed that 💪💯
	He do what he gotta do ✅
	This data looks good.
	I told y'all. Bucks are the Clippers of the East, and none of y'all don't care.
	Ivan Sanchez Orbe ?? Clippers dont have champ!! You compare them to the one who sweep the miami
	CaiRel MarTy I'm talking about Doc Rivers being the coach for the Bucks.
	This guy has been sensational this season
	Bring back bud
	Great job 👏🏾
	Jb standing on business
	M.V.P.
