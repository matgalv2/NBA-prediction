	Great win
	Kings got this win the bucks just didn't play well tonight
	Tyrone Moore just take the L and move it along
	Raul Velasco I'm not mad about it
	Great win by sac.  Bad road trip for the bucks still season left and as I always say play ur best ball at the end in the playoffs it's so based on matchups some teams dont match up well with others
	Best win
	wow the same margin in the warriors win over the Bucks. Funny how the NBA downplays the Kings season
	Great win for the Kings, even though my team is the Warriors, I have often wondered why is it that the Kings do not get the recognition that the other California teams get?
	And they will play lakers tomorrow still sabonis is AD's father
	With the exception of Boston this just highlights again how much stronger the west is
	Bucks are so overrated
	Congratulations Kings team and great performance Sabonis and Fox.
	Whoa huge victory. Well done Kings!!
	Kings eat Bucks
	Cant change the fact kings will bye bye during 1st round
	Play off exit haha kings is not a championship caliber
	Doc rivers  is in  troubled  he been winning  on talented  so long he does  have strategy  when the team get behind  in the quarters don't  know how to adjusted
	Once again, Vimbanyamama is dominating the rookie stats, where do you think his ceiling is?
	I really could not fathom how the mighty bucks got man handled by the ALLSTARLESS kings. I'm losing my mind 😮
	Wow!! Excellent job Kings!! Please keep it going!!!😁❤️👍🏀
	Bucks will exit the PO's in the 1st round
	Kings have been VERY inconsistent this year
	Ah must win Lakers is on the way
	Shoulnt have hired doc rivers lol
	That’s rough
	What a win
	💪🏾🦊🔦🟣
	Doc Rivers,hired to “fix the defense” 💀💀🤣🤣
	Andre Jackson Jr. with a monster tip dunk, BANG!
	How did the Bucks win 42 games, when everytime I turn around their loosing🤔
	Think this was one of the worst shooting games in the bucks whole season, sucked to watch but it happens 🤷‍♂️
	Bucks were completely outplayed. Doesn't bode well for the playoffs at all.
	The Kings are adorable. 😅
	Even De'aaron makes zero point bucks still lost.
	What has happened to milwaukee?
	And Yannis Antetokumpo is Player of the game
	very nice
	Beautiful following everyone ✅
	The joy of discovering a new favorite song and playing it on repeat for days!
	Thanasis is only around to be a cheerleader 🤣
	Giannis ain’t the goat. Lebron at Giannis’s prime right now would have single handily beat the Queens 🤴. Need queens to lose smh 🤦🏻‍♂️.
