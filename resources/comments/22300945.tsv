	 just take the L and move it along
	 how are you doing
	Great win by sac.  Bad road trip for the bucks still season left and as I always say play ur best ball at the end in the playoffs it's so based on matchups some teams dont match up well with others
	Best win
	Great win for the Kings, even though my team is the Warriors, I have often wondered why is it that the Kings do not get the recognition that the other California teams get?
	wow the same margin in the warriors win over the Bucks. Funny how the NBA downplays the Kings season
	 I agree
	My lakers gone kick they azz tomorrow watch we let them win last game we up 20🤬 but we owe queens
	 actually Sabonis owns y’all and especially AD who has never beaten a Sabonis team… 0-9
	 keep that same energy lol watch tonight
	 I’ll keep the same energy as the last 9 times
	 good for queens regular season team
	 bro y’all front running ass fans. Oh cool you’re a lakers fan that’s something to brag about lol try being a fan of a team that doesn’t have everything catered to them and then talk that shit
	 I been with ljames and AD since high school that’s who am with clown
	 what you gonna do when LeBron retires and AD never beats a Sabonis team and starts getting hurt again? What bandwagon you gonna attach yourself to next?
	 u talk slow new players are always born smh. And queens won’t win a championship no time soon at all lol. Regular season team they are
	 id rather be a fan of a team that never wins a chip then bandwagon with whoever’s hot at the moment. That’s some lame ass shit lol
	 your thoughts
	 that’s the consensus
	 dude find something to do dam
	 light the beam. Now Sabonis is 10-0 vs Davis
	When the Lakers  get health  the Lakers and nuggets  in final rematch  that what the  nba wants and Vagas  wants
	And they will play lakers tomorrow still sabonis is AD's father
	 🙄🙄🙄
	 this aged well!!!
	With the exception of Boston this just highlights again how much stronger the west is
	 true
	 how are you doing??
	 Hi hw are you doing I'm very glad to send you this message I come across your profile pic and it really amazing and I try sending you a friend request but not going through can you please send me a friend request if you mind hansom ❤

	Doc rivers  is in  troubled  he been winning  on talented  so long he does  have strategy  when the team get behind  in the quarters don't  know how to adjusted
	Once again, Vimbanyamama is dominating the rookie stats, where do you think his ceiling is?
	Bucks will exit the PO's in the 1st round
	  I'm a Bucks fan, and I've been trying to have some hope in the last few weeks...but I'm starting to agree with you.
	 ... If they get Miami again... It's highly possible!
	Kings have been VERY inconsistent this year
