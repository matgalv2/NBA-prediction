	Congratulations

	L.A Lakers loss and Golden State win, what great day! 🔥💪 🫡
	Durant
	Kinda pathetic. A dude with his skills should be averaging 35
	James Langley Hello baby how are you doing today ? I’m available for fun , incall and outcall available  and would you like to meet ?
	Emily David call me on my cell phone late night when you need some love
	James Langley you can DM me direct on my chat 💬 for more fun 🎢
	James Langley
	Richard Porter lmao Luka is averaging 34.6….you should’ve kept the duct tape on!
	James Langley that's cool Luka also doesn't have book and beal
	Richard Porter AND? All he needs it 4 more FGA’s per game to match Luka’s. That’s easily attainable if he demanded the ball more. They play the same minutes. KD too soft and doesn’t have mamba mentality
	James Langley Luka is a lot younger. KD is 35+. Are you aware how poorly most players tend to play by 35?
	James Langley well lets just see ,how long both of this player can go on playoffs
	James Langley Did you just forget that he had an achilles injury? Who else came back still averaging all star numbers after that kind of injury besides Kobe and Dominique Wilkins in the whole history of the Nba?
	Arvin Estevanez Which is funny because people shouldn't have expected this kind of KD to return. He literally made people forget that he had an achilles injury or they tryna downplay it like an achilles injury ain't that big of a deal smh
	Kapag pumasok sa Final ang Sun malamang si Durant ang MVP
	l’m Paying 5 Grands to the First 10 Lucky ones to DM me “ALIVE” cus I feel people  are still going through hard times. God bless Y’all
	Next up:Gsw
	Thanks for restoring my happiness I was really depressed due to my financial issues and to my greatest surprise I got opportunity that changed my life from the investment I started with you few months back your reliability can't be equated
