TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The bucks got issues no team but san Antonio, detroit or the hornets should have trouble with the wiz
	Anthony Core don’t sleep on the spurs give a season or 2 and they’ll be contenders again
	Tichael Moon I know they're better than their record but they aren't good yet I know they're on the rise though
	This is the reason why the 8th seeded Miami defeated them in the playoffs.
	Doc rivers fault for poor late game management. Especially when he took Giannis out when they cut a 14 point lead down to 2. They had the momentum and were about to take the lead and he killed it 🤡
	The wizards only good player didn’t even play, this is embarrassing 🤣
	Jackson Burgess john wall?? Cause JP is not a good player xD
	José Pablo Cortés JP did play…
	The bucks just being nice 😊
	Milwaukee 👎, only 15-14 with Rivers. Luckily they pass first round  If they won't play against Miami.
	Doc Rivers in the east is the Ty Lue in the west. Overrated and lucky enough to get carried by multiple superstars to win 1 chip, that's it. 😆
	Man, Milwaukee is struggling a lot this season.
	Nicholas Schumacher why is that
	Carol Morales Walker They're underachieving for the players they have. Just my opinion.
	Nicholas Schumacher ohh okay I see
	Nicholas Schumacher wel good morning Nichol am Caroline
	Another first round playoff exit for the Bucks
	Doc Rivers in playoff mode early🔥
	Imagine losing to Washington 😭
	Mike Miner anything unfortunately is possibly in the NBA.
	Maria Nicole facts
	😭
	Mike Miner I want to cry but I have to remember what I just told you. Still hurts.
	😭 but I’m also a Blackhawks fan so. Still cry
	Mike Miner I’m a Blackhawk’s fan too…
	😭 so sad
	😂
	At this point don't be like that team.(Milwaukee Bucks)
	Bucks not gonna make it out the 1st round 😏
	"""Sorry coach, I know we're tanking - but have you actually considered the minute difference in odds of actually getting that top pick? I'm gonna ball..."" Corey"
	Man just when you bet that Milwaukee will win then boom, inconsistency wins 🤦🏽‍♂️
	Doc Rivers has the Bucks in playoff mode earlier Ryan usual 😏
	Why win games at this point. You should be tryna get the #1 pick in the draft! 🤔
	Jaymontae Smith They will have the same chance to get the #1 pick regardless lol. Their record is that bad.
	Kevin Jones I don’t think that is how it works nowadays. Worst record gets best pick.
	Jaymontae Smith false, it is a draft lottery. The bottom 3 teams have the same percent chance to get the first pick.
	😂
	😂
	😎
	The bucks odds were crazy on FD 💀
	I love when the bucks lose 😭😭😭
	Bucks ain’t making it out the first round with doc 😂
	Washington native and Gonzaga grad 💪💪
	Corey Kispert the Wizard beat the Bucks, Giannis Antetokounmpo was on form however
	Thanasis is the secret weapon🔥
	Now 1-6 without Lillard 👀
	Good to see Kevin Love still playing
	Avoiding heat 🔥
	I had to double check it wasn’t April 1st
	What the hell is wrong with the bucks lol
	Vegas needed some money tonight
	But yall think the got a chance. They just lost to the 2nd worst team in the league
	Doc Revers effect
	Jv Galvez     This dude is guaranteed $40 Million !!!!
	Oh yeah Mamaah men😎😅
	Jovz Intan Monredondo Out of here can add anyone but I would like us to chat on here
	Giannis Loses with a Triple Double
	My parlay died with this
	What's Up Doc?!
	Where was the defense?  Layup after layup.
	Thank you doc rivers
	Why I'm happy.🤧
	He's good.
	Fire Doc Rivers
	Doc effect 😂
	Really bucks ? 😮😄🙈
	Guarantee Washington wizards doesn’t win tomorrow ..The king will be in town…
	sayang di na ka bet
	Are the Bucks changing coach after the loss against the Wizards? Thats The Wizards!!
	Giannis in the locker room after fighting the former head coach just to get Doc Rivers lmao 😂🤣
	I wonder if anybody still thinks Adrian Griffin sucked?? 33-13 I think he was and they got rid of him…hmmmm 14-15 since!!! Not sure why u shake up 33-13?!!!
	WHO???? Milwaukee is stumbling.... This team supposed to dominate 😭😭😭
	What good is nepotism when you don't let your superstar Thanasis play?
	Good Lord! Juat throw the whole team away. Doc needs to retire and go back to being a commentator, and the Bucks need to just go on fishing and regroup for next year! What are they doing?!!😳🤦🏽‍♀️
	Joey Reyes
	Charles
	Cody Buse
	Em Cheech
	🤣
	🫠
	Jesse Hawkins y’all took back too back Ls agasint the hawks
	Peter Vll ya cuz take the L
	😂😂😂
	Well if nobody guards him then yeah he's probably gonna have a break out game. 
	This is the reason why the 8th seeded Miami defeated them in the playoffs.
	He’s got such a clean shot
	It’s official. Bucks are winning it all.
