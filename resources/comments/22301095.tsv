	This is the reason why the 8th seeded Miami defeated them in the playoffs.
	The bucks got issues no team but san Antonio, detroit or the hornets should have trouble with the wiz
	 don’t sleep on the spurs give a season or 2 and they’ll be contenders again
	 I know they're better than their record but they aren't good yet I know they're on the rise though
	Doc rivers fault for poor late game management. Especially when he took Giannis out when they cut a 14 point lead down to 2. They had the momentum and were about to take the lead and he killed it 🤡
	The wizards only good player didn’t even play, this is embarrassing 🤣
	 john wall?? Cause JP is not a good player xD
	 JP did play…
	The bucks just being nice 😊
	Milwaukee 👎, only 15-14 with Rivers. Luckily they pass first round  If they won't play against Miami.
	Doc Rivers in the east is the Ty Lue in the west. Overrated and lucky enough to get carried by multiple superstars to win 1 chip, that's it. 😆
	Lucky for them Thanasis didn't play
	Man, Milwaukee is struggling a lot this season.
	Doc Rivers in playoff mode early🔥
	At this point don't be like that team.(Milwaukee Bucks)
	Another first round playoff exit for the Bucks
	Imagine losing to Washington 😭
	 anything unfortunately is possibly in the NBA.
	 facts
	 literally crazy, and I’m a Bucks fan. 😭
	 I want to cry but I have to remember what I just told you. Still hurts.
	 I’m a Dallas fan I’m happy I’m not crying anymore 😭 but I’m also a Blackhawks fan so. Still cry
	 I’m a Blackhawk’s fan too…
	 so you double cried tonight 😭 so sad
	 like the Knicks losing to San Antonio 😂
	Bucks not gonna make it out the 1st round 😏
	Man just when you bet that Milwaukee will win then boom, inconsistency wins 🤦🏽‍♂️
	"""Sorry coach, I know we're tanking - but have you actually considered the minute difference in odds of actually getting that top pick? I'm gonna ball..."" Corey"
	I love when the bucks lose 😭😭😭
	Why win games at this point. You should be tryna get the #1 pick in the draft! 🤔
	Doc Rivers has the Bucks in playoff mode earlier Ryan usual 😏
	Bucks ain’t making it out the first round with doc 😂
	The bucks odds were crazy on FD 💀
	Washington native and Gonzaga grad 💪💪
	Corey Kispert the Wizard beat the Bucks, Giannis Antetokounmpo was on form however
	Now 1-6 without Lillard 👀
	Thanasis is the secret weapon🔥
	Good to see Kevin Love still playing
	Avoiding heat 🔥
	I had to double check it wasn’t April 1st
	What the hell is wrong with the bucks lol
	Vegas needed some money tonight
	But yall think the got a chance. They just lost to the 2nd worst team in the league
	Oh yeah Mamaah men😎😅
	Doc Revers effect
	Giannis Loses with a Triple Double
	Where was the defense?  Layup after layup.
	My parlay died with this
	Thank you doc rivers
	What's Up Doc?!
	Fire Doc Rivers
	Why I'm happy.🤧
	He's good.
	Doc effect 😂
	Really bucks ? 😮😄🙈
	Guarantee Washington wizards doesn’t win tomorrow ..The king will be in town…
	sayang di na ka bet
	Are the Bucks changing coach after the loss against the Wizards? Thats The Wizards!!
	Giannis in the locker room after fighting the former head coach just to get Doc Rivers lmao 😂🤣
	I wonder if anybody still thinks Adrian Griffin sucked?? 33-13 I think he was and they got rid of him…hmmmm 14-15 since!!! Not sure why u shake up 33-13?!!!
	WHO???? Milwaukee is stumbling.... This team supposed to dominate 😭😭😭
	What good is nepotism when you don't let your superstar Thanasis play?
	Good Lord! Juat throw the whole team away. Doc needs to retire and go back to being a commentator, and the Bucks need to just go on fishing and regroup for next year! What are they doing?!!😳🤦🏽‍♀️
	
	
	
	
	 🤣
	 🫠
	😂😂😂
	Well if nobody guards him then yeah he's probably gonna have a break out game. 
	This is the reason why the 8th seeded Miami defeated them in the playoffs.
	He’s got such a clean shot
	It’s official. Bucks are winning it all.
