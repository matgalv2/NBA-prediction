TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	shai is very far from what luka has done. It's just luck that they are first because there are many good people in Oklahoma and the coach is good
	Alexander Espanto Luka play for himself that why Mavs sucks
	Alexander Espanto you see, when the Thunder are up 20 Shai doesn’t play the 4th quarter. Unlike Luka, who plays almost the whole 4th when they’re up 20 to get his stats.
	Colton Cellars That happened once. Don’t try and play like it’s an every day thing.
	Brent Golden we’ll see
	Colton Cellars If they focused on doing that, Luka would have like 150 triple doubles already. Numerous times he’s been 1 rebound or 1 assist short.
	Colton Cellars Triple double tonight with 6 minutes left in 3rd. Is that sufficient for you?
	🫣
	Alexander Espanto if SGA was on the Mavs they’d be a top seed still. 
	Alexander Espanto luck? You know each member of the team puts in work right? Not just expect a superstar to carry them all. Shai didn’t even play a single minute in the 4th quarter. No stat padding just pure love of the game. That’s what makes him bett… Wyświetl więcej
	Alexander Espanto Dude.  You can dick ride your boy and still recognize greatness in others.
	Alexander Espanto ur a dumbass. Shai is shooting better then Luka. He score more 30 plus pts then Luka done all season. He shooting better in ft pct, fg pct. He has the most pts in the nba then Luka. Shai a better leader then Luka. He improves his teammates and Luka can't even do that that why he needs a superstar to wins games. Shai doesn't need superstar to win like Luka to be number 1 in the west
	Alexander Espanto
	Alexander Espanto explain how luka got a game with 73 points yet Shai still got more points made the whole season
	Alexander Espanto DUMMY
	Those are the nicest OKC jerseys by far.they should rock them more
	He is clearly the MVP. He carries a team that has rookie second option and Karl Malone 2.0 as 3rd option.
	Serkan Karatepe Giddey is not the 3rd option, Chet actually is. We have JDub as the 2nd option
	Serkan Karatepe No.  JDUB is a second year player and clear second option.  Chet is the third and Giddey isn't even on the list this season.  Probably better off giving Joe his minutes.
	Serkan Karatepe you just love to hear yourself yap
	Serkan Karatepenot only carries the team, he also carries the ball, lol.
	Serkan Karatepe
	We all knew okc would be here after the cp3 absence, they showed they can follow and sga is that guy!
	Man okc is a for real team I think they can handle anyone in the play off
	Kevin Otey
	Kevin Otey  hi
	Chet losing steam. In fairness, he’d been playing every single game but he looks like he needs a couple of days off to recharge.
	Sean Somera 4 day break coming up in a weeks time after the next Grizzlies game a chance for all to recharge their batteries.
	Sean Somera he was banged up a few games ago so I agree. But Chet plays through and learns. He had some really good dunks in that game. He’s probably not ROTY over Wemby but he’s a damn good player!
	SGA didn’t get the 31 tonite so he beat em by 31 instead.. I see what you did Shai
	Hope they bounce the Lakers out of the playoffs.
	only lakers can defeat sga...
	Ric Dayego Guinto mavs literally beat them by 35 points like 10 games ago…
	Compared to Michael Jordan, who is more powerful in terms of James' versatility on the court and his impact on the team as a whole?
	Doing gooder or as good as KD in his MVP season!!!! Look it up!!!
	Jetz Bugler hi
	Cynthia Butler hi
	Jetz Bugler how are you doing love you
	Like this young good team
	shai is very far from what luka has done. It's just luck that they are first because there are many good people in Oklahoma and the coach is good
	Deep bag SGA
	of course giddy had 16
	Them boys balling
	MVP right here
	😂
	😂
	Ross Hër Gęntlė Mån he didn’t play the 4th quarter due to the massive blowout lol
	Edwin Gardea really?
	MVP this man!!!!
	SGA 🔛🔝
	We all knew okc would be here after the cp3 absence, they showed they can follow and sga is that guy!  .only lakers can defeat sga...  .
	Team Canada's Offense will be tough to stop with SGA and Murry if both are healthy for Olympics.
	Much love ❤️
	Congratulations on your success 🙌 👏!
	GG put up 30 😮‍💨
	Has the Southern-style NBA matchup won by the Oklahoma City Thunder? Yes, they did over the Atlanta Hawks. Has the Southern-style NBA matchup won by the Thunder? Yes, they did over the Hawks.
	Chet with 8 points and 6 rebounds and the game before he had 7 &amp; 3 but yet people still think he's better than Wemby 🤣 dude is literally carried by SGA
	Anthony Garza Chet looks tired to me.. these long seasons are gonna wear on the frail body more than ppl think.. he’s a great player and young players hit a wall at times but. Let’s stop talking like wemby isn’t roty but not only is he miles ahead for that, if he stays healthy in that frame, he is gonna b all time great type good.. he already throws down dunks. I’ve never even seen before just because he can. He is already the best shot blocker in the world and I don’t know why people keep testing him because he’s gonna paste it. Rookie or not Wembanyama is going to be a major problem. Now the spurs just need to somehow land Dillingham ￼ who won the opinion should go number one in the draft. I just think his upside is the best of anybody that I’ve seen in this class. Once he puts on some weight and gains three-point range I don’t see anybody in this draft, with higher upside than Rob Dillingham, the fastest player with the ball in the country. He doesn’t always show it because sometimes he fires up as soon as he gets it but he’s probably got to be the hardest player To guard and watch. If somehow Kentucky makes a really deep run. It’s gonna be on Rob Dillingham’s back more so than anybody. Him, and reed Sheppard stock is through the roof.. ￼ when was the last time one college team produced two top five picks that we’re both bench players, and not even starters? Don’t think it’s ever happened.
	Anthony Garza You gonna count stats from a game he barely played in because they were up thirty in the first half?  When you look like you're reaching hard it's because your narrative is bogus, brah.
	🤡s would be all over him
	Anthony Garza Dude.  No one in Oklahoma gives a shit about the RotY.  We're thinking about the post season and taking care of business.  Have fun baiting worms, turd.
	Justin Brooke have fun watching your team lose to Denver at least my team has 5 championships what does yours have dweeb
	🤣
	Anthony Garza Quit living in the past and making goofy predictions.  We beat Denver three times this season, cas.  Pay attention.
	🤣 and regular season and playoffs is a different game Denver has the experience
	Anthony Garza You can talk all that jibber jabber about experience.  How much expensive does Pop have?  You're already mathematically eliminated from the playoffs.  Your argument stinks.  Shaq, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnet all have OKC as not only legit contenders, but as the team to beat in the west.  But I'm gonna listen to some butthurt LP who has nothing to look forward to for the next four years.
	Anthony Garza What do you know about playoffs, geek?  And you know in three years you're gonna be saying the exact opposite of all this when SA is coming back up.  Poser.
	Justin Brooke My Spurs made the playoffs for 22 straight seasons , And OKC has missed the playoffs the last couple of years till this season so what do you know, At least I know about my team winning championships like I said what has your team done
	🤷
	Justin Brooke Remember in 2014 when the Spurs beat the Thunder 4-2 then went on to actually win a championship?
	Justin Brooke But did they win anything after that ? Nope
	Anthony Garza Have fun watching that guy with the blonde hair run around turning the ball over the next three years.
	Justin Brooke Have fun watching your team lose in the playoffs and Wemby dominating Chet for the rest of their careers
	You laugh at lot.  Does that make you feel less blatantly incorrect?
	Has anyone actually checked the OKC link in the title?
	Looks like GG Jackson led them to the win
	That OKC tag in this post is not what you think it is!  😂😂😂
	The LIP 💋 keep on going....
	Team Canada's Offense will be tough to stop with SGA and Murry if both are healthy for Olympics.
	Who is GG Jackson? I assume y’all talking about JJJ 🤣
	I wonder if this guy is related 2 Ja Morant…..

	For me after Tatum the number 2 Favorit to win the mvp … yesterday the sport reporters in Europe say that tatuk will win the mvp and I agree because he is in his team the number 1 with a big gap … jokic without Murray have done nothing . They lose 10 games from 15 without Murray and jokic has 9 points games 15 point games and 17 … nobody remember ??? Why ? Because it’s a bid purpose … tatuk is the mvp with Boston’s celtics have the best record
	George Tolik Tatum has a stacked team. Take him off and Celtics are still at least top 3 in the weak east. Take Shai and Jokic out, and their teams are probably not making the playoffs in the stacked west, especially the Thunder
	George Tolik tatum is weak
