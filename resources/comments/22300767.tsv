MIL	The guy’s a beast. So happy for Bucks fans. Giannis is a special man…….and story.
DEN	Every match up against Denver, the MVP contenders always make a statement.
	Ikenna F. Nnoli embiid ducked all those games
MIL	Giannis either needs to start getting the delay of game calls or shooting his free throws quicker. this is become egregious again.
	Prediction, east finals vs knicks. To lose in a tough game 7. Its still knicks year
	Ian Austria Celtics will be in the East finals no question there
	Ian Austria Knicks won't be there
	I'd rather put my money on Detroit than on Knicks
MIL	Ian Austria Kareem Abdul jabarr firs champion Milwaukee bucks 2 giannis antitokampo
	Ian Austria put the pipe down
MIL	Uh no. Bucks will smash Knicks when it counts.
	Could only watch part of the final quarter.   Great work guys!

	Not even one assist 😅...that's why reborn is the goat
	Little Smalls Mtengano 5 assists, a quick Google search would’ve saved you from looking dumb
MIL	Bucks is now 2-0 since they got patbev
DEN	Nuggets need the All star break they look completely disinterested and tired. It's coming at a perfect time for them. They need the games to matter so they can kick into the gear that won it all lol
MIL	Giannis becoming more and more underrated in the NBA
	Karabo Brunny not costant
	Karabo Brunny he stealed a ball from jokic as a kid. But still they will say that slow white guy is an MVP. Not even close to giannis chamberlain or the goat Kareem.
	Nicolás Esteban cope
	Murray 3 points.
	he got serious injury again
	When Change your racing shirt for the better. Bucks haha
MIL	Enjoy the regular season bucks.. And cry in playoffss.. Second round exit
	Juan Saavedra hate yourself, not the effort ✌️
MIL	Juan Saavedra whatever bucks going all the way lets go bucks 🦌💚

	Elena Savino do you remember how Jimmy butler washed Milwaukee and giannis??? 😂😂😂
	Elena Savino first round exit dude.. How funny it was???
	Juan Saavedra wala pa champion si buttler iyak
MIL	Elena Savino first round exit .. let's see.  How Giannis will fire their coach.
	Juan Saavedra what's your point of these comments?
	Elena Savino can you clarify your English dude . It's disgusting..🤣🤗 watch the grammar study in YouTube dude it's free.
	Juan Saavedra Kareem legendary Milwaukee bucks
	Elena Savino I preferred bill Russell dude . 11 championship . The goat and legendary
	Juan Saavedra 🙏
	Juan Saavedra jokic fan girl?
	Juan Saavedra parang Celtics mo lang..
MIL	Nice work, Giannis!!

DEN	I can not believe the leagues best player allowed his team to lose by so much to a team trying to find itself with a new coach.
	Jonathan Washington got owned in the paint again, he's a big PG.
	Denver Nuggets Vs Milwaukee Bucks
MIL	The goat GIannis 🏀🏀🏀✊✊
	He must be Lionel Richie’s son 🙂. Look at AMA 1985 ceremony before you diss me 😀😀
	Giannis is not an old LeBron Jokic can easily dominate.. 😃😃
	Giannis Antetokounmpo
	Gonna be crazy losing in the 2nd round to the Knicks
	And what about tonight heat by 30 points, you know what all the organization are disgusting 🤮all of them.
	Nobody else had a chance because the stat paddling bloke only plays for himself
	David James-Moller often leads the teams in assists but whatever 🤷🏼‍♀️ Also, with his ability in the paint, no need for anyone else. Smh

	Denver / Milwaukee, the next NBA 2024 finals.
	Getting 4 points total from Murray and KCP is a problem 🤦🏼‍♂️ nice win, Bucks 👏🏼
	Lincoln Jones jokic had more points then the 4 other started combined
	Boris Tesla Bee it’s crazy 🤦🏼‍♂️ not a great showing, but we’ll bounce back
	Lincoln Jones yes have to. Too bad no trades were able to be made but yes one bad game against a great team
	Lincoln Jones and Murray usually shows up for the Bucks…
