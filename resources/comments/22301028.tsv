TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAC	The Clippers absolutely falling down
LAC	Clippers straight Garbage 2nd round exit is in their Future
LAC	If I’m the clippers I’m thinking of doing a full rebuild after losing to the 76ers. Quite embarassing
LAC	Vito TwoFederal no heart since russ been down but they won’t pay him
LAC	Michael Gayent they were losing with Westbrook
LAC	Anthony Davis they was competing every game
LAC	Michael Gayent they are still competing
LAC	Anthony Davis not at all
LAC	Michael Gayent yes they do.
	"I'm clearing off the debts/bills of first 5 people to message me ""PAID”"
LAC	Vito TwoFederal good thing you are on couch watching games instead of a GM
LAC	David Pillay no kidding
LAC	Vito TwoFederaljust because one game？
LAC	Simon Chen have you not been watching the last 20??
LAC	The clippers playing without aggressiveness to win a game
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Los Angeles Clippers
LAC	Clippers should be embarrassed. They aren’t winning anything. Enjoy the new arena though….
	😂😂😂
LAC	Joselito P. Navarro this game solidified it for me. Your “big 3” healthy and couldn’t beat a mediocre 76s team.
PHI	Great win Sixers
LAC	Clippers content on playing the 4/5 seed series.
LAC	Fired ty lue the clippers will be champion
LAC	This clippers team is terrible - that block on Paul George from Tobias was so good once of the game changers in the match.
PHI	Oliver Smith Kelly Oubre blocked Paul George
PHI	Why can’t he do this constantly
PHI	Jerry Cook the world may never know...
LAC	Clippers can't beat 76ers but Lakers can beat the 76ers
	🤟🏽❤️‍🔥
	Cool
	Maria Iren D. Villamer
	The nba is so rigged it’s hilarious
PHI	Losing to the 76ers without Embiid...Typical Clippers
PHI	Bum !!
PHI	Tobias Harris 🏀 = Weekend 🎙️
PHI	I don't like his taper fade..I could have done that better..
PHI	HERE. COME. THE. PELICANS! 😈
PHI	Now stay consistent you bum
PHI	Tobias is a great player but he was getting less touches in Philly. Without Joel he's getting the ball a lot more and showing everyone that he can still ball.
PHI	Jean Claude Derieux *on occasion.. Embiids been out for a month and a half and the Sixers have needed that way more than what they've gotten
PHI	Leo 'Strugz' Gayten true
PHI	Jean Claude Derieux you don’t watch games obviously? He was 1 for 6 the other night w 2pts
PHI	Jean Claude Derieux what are you smoking.
LAC	Shame on the Clippers! Stacked with superstars but still performing below expectations.💔
	Esto  si es un fracaso x dios como esos cliper no sirven
PHI	Bum... now he wants to score 24 lol 🤣😂🤣
PHI	I forgot that was revenge for him
	Aaaaaand we’re back
PHI	I will forever love my team.... i'm a proud sixer
	tatay gerrardo lozano left the group🤣🤣
PHI	Tobias Harris
PHI	Well, ask ur self sixers fans : want to see unreliable tobias score 2 points,next day score 15 and the next day score 24 points next year? Or trade him and got more dependable and reliable +younger player?me?ain't paid and keep 35 million undeserve unreliable player next year,because joel is 30 years Old,his prime time almost gone+i will keep campayne for cheap friendly contract as 2nd team roster ....but,morey maybe want to give him(tobias) max contract 🙂
PHI	Tobias Harris
