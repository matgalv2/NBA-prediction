	The Clippers absolutely falling down
	If I’m the clippers I’m thinking of doing a full rebuild after losing to the 76ers. Quite embarassing
	The clippers playing without aggressiveness to win a game
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Clippers should be embarrassed. They aren’t winning anything. Enjoy the new arena though….
	 hahaha…nothing new with the Clippers since they always choke when games matter the most😂😂😂
	Great win Sixers
	Clippers content on playing the 4/5 seed series.
	Fired ty lue the clippers will be champion
	This clippers team is terrible - that block on Paul George from Tobias was so good once of the game changers in the match. 
	 Kelly Oubre blocked Paul George
	Why can’t he do this constantly
	Clippers can't beat 76ers but Lakers can beat the 76ers
	🤟🏽❤️‍🔥
	
	The nba is so rigged it’s hilarious
	Losing to the 76ers without Embiid...Typical Clippers
	Tobias Harris 🏀 = Weekend 🎙️
	I don't like his taper fade..I could have done that better..
	HERE. COME. THE. PELICANS! 😈
	Shame on the Clippers! Stacked with superstars but still performing below expectations.💔
	Tobias is a great player but he was getting less touches in Philly. Without Joel he's getting the ball a lot more and showing everyone that he can still ball.
	 *on occasion.. Embiids been out for a month and a half and the Sixers have needed that way more than what they've gotten
	 true
	Bum... now he wants to score 24 lol 🤣😂🤣
	I forgot that was revenge for him
	Aaaaaand we’re back
	I will forever love my team.... i'm a proud sixer
	Well, ask ur self sixers fans : want to see unreliable tobias score 2 points,next day score 15 and the next day score 24 points next year? Or trade him and got more dependable and reliable +younger player?me?ain't paid and keep 35 million undeserve <a tabindex=
