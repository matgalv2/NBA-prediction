	The Clippers absolutely falling down
	Clippers straight Garbage 2nd round exit is in their Future
	If I’m the clippers I’m thinking of doing a full rebuild after losing to the 76ers. Quite embarassing
	Vito TwoFederal no heart since russ been down but they won’t pay him
	Michael Gayent they were losing with Westbrook
	Anthony Davis they was competing every game
	Michael Gayent they are still competing
	Anthony Davis not at all
	Michael Gayent yes they do.
	"I'm clearing off the debts/bills of first 5 people to message me ""PAID”"
	Vito TwoFederal good thing you are on couch watching games instead of a GM
	David Pillay no kidding
	Vito TwoFederaljust because one game？
	Simon Chen have you not been watching the last 20??
	The clippers playing without aggressiveness to win a game
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	Clippers should be embarrassed. They aren’t winning anything. Enjoy the new arena though….
	😂😂😂
	Joselito P. Navarro this game solidified it for me. Your “big 3” healthy and couldn’t beat a mediocre 76s team.
	Great win Sixers
	Clippers content on playing the 4/5 seed series.
	Fired ty lue the clippers will be champion
	This clippers team is terrible - that block on Paul George from Tobias was so good once of the game changers in the match. 
	Oliver Smith Kelly Oubre blocked Paul George
	Why can’t he do this constantly
	Jerry Cook the world may never know...
	Clippers can't beat 76ers but Lakers can beat the 76ers
	🤟🏽❤️‍🔥
	Cool
	Maria Iren D. Villamer
	The nba is so rigged it’s hilarious
	Losing to the 76ers without Embiid...Typical Clippers
	Bum !!
	Tobias Harris 🏀 = Weekend 🎙️
	I don't like his taper fade..I could have done that better..
	HERE. COME. THE. PELICANS! 😈
	Now stay consistent you bum
	Tobias is a great player but he was getting less touches in Philly. Without Joel he's getting the ball a lot more and showing everyone that he can still ball.
	Jean Claude Derieux *on occasion.. Embiids been out for a month and a half and the Sixers have needed that way more than what they've gotten
	Leo 'Strugz' Gayten true
	Jean Claude Derieux you don’t watch games obviously? He was 1 for 6 the other night w 2pts
	Jean Claude Derieux what are you smoking.
	Shame on the Clippers! Stacked with superstars but still performing below expectations.💔
	Esto  si es un fracaso x dios como esos cliper no sirven
	Bum... now he wants to score 24 lol 🤣😂🤣
	I forgot that was revenge for him
	Aaaaaand we’re back
	I will forever love my team.... i'm a proud sixer
	tatay gerrardo lozano left the group🤣🤣
	Tobias Harris
	Well, ask ur self sixers fans : want to see unreliable tobias score 2 points,next day score 15 and the next day score 24 points next year? Or trade him and got more dependable and reliable +younger player?me?ain't paid and keep 35 million undeserve unreliable player next year,because joel is 30 years Old,his prime time almost gone+i will keep campayne for cheap friendly contract as 2nd team roster ....but,morey maybe want to give him(tobias) max contract 🙂
