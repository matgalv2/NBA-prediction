TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Jp youRe great and doing well!! They traded jp because jp is younger than them 😂😂
	Kispert had a good game
	Matthew Yep
	Goat
	I noticed Poole and kispert play well together, they look out for each other and they won the game without Kuz and Avdija I like the players but the chemistry is not completely there yet
	Jordan Poole is my favorite Washington Wizards player If all time
	John John Turner I hope you’re a teenager and have never seen Michael jordan, juwan howard, chris webber, mitch richmond, jerry stackhouse, rip Hamilton, rod Strickland, muggsy bogues, manute bol, or george murresean

	Tomorrow Miami vs warriors

	Jordan poole was good for warriors but won't exceed to nothing more in his career especially with wizards...harsh truth
	Chris Selmes not really
