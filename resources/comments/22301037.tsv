	Jp youRe great and doing well!! They traded jp because jp is younger than them 😂😂
	Kispert had a good game
	
	Goat
	I noticed Poole and kispert play well together, they look out for each other and they won the game without Kuz and Avdija I like the players but the chemistry is not completely there yet
	Jordan Poole is my favorite Washington Wizards player If all time
	 I hope you’re a teenager and have never seen Michael jordan, juwan howard, chris webber, mitch richmond, jerry stackhouse, rip Hamilton, rod Strickland, muggsy bogues, manute bol, or george murresean
	Tomorrow Miami vs warriors
	Great player ❤️Love Poole 🙏🏀
	Do the  NBA ever get an off season?
	Jordan poole was good for warriors but won't exceed to nothing more in his career especially with wizards...harsh truth
	 not really
	Go wizard 💪💪💪
	GS does not need a big man.They miss Jordan Poole.
	Longest winning streak in the East lol
	Whaou qui pouvait imaginer ? Les wizards viennent déjà en force very good
