TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Thunder come out of the All-Star break and win the first two by a combined 63 points….TOUGH 😤 💪
	This team means business! Only hope they show up come playoff time
	I’m sure the Shanghai Sharks and NorthPort Batang Pier would sweep the Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards in a 7 game series 😤🔥😩😭☠️🤣
	Johnny Wang quota ka na.
	Johnny Wang - not that northport batang pier again !!
	Wang daily wisdom
	Simply SGA being SGA! 🔥
	They destroyed my clippers we will see playoff time what OKC is about
	Donald Ray Justice Sr. You’re already seeing what they’re about.
	What a great team to win against 🤣
	Al Guffy It was a win besides the name your parents gave you ! Ha ha
	Jerome D Tiger you're a scary man 😂🤣
	Al Guffy Yep!!
	Al Guffy right? the Celtics were easy to beat for my Thunder
	Clay Garland without the starters 🤣
	Al Guffy Jaysom Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday are not your starters? Hmm strange. I thought they were. 🤡
	Al Guffy so basically they all are not starters if one can't show up for the start of the game?
	Jerome D Tiger wait and see 👊
	Al Guffy make sure you know what you're talking about before saying anything. That's why you're quiet now
	All Star game defense continued.
	Handling business the okc way 💪
	MVP! If not for the Joker!
	Hey, which team is this that I can count their victories with my fingers after playing 56 games?
	He is the mvp for the regular season after the injury from embiid .. embiid have won with ease the mvp but injury was against him … mvp is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
	George Tolik nah!! still far behind triple double machine Nikola Jokic.
	Ιdint think you have idea about basketball because he makes triple double to make interesting .. jokic is a player wh n I see him play I fall in sleep .. he plays very boring in a soft era … shai gilgeous and Tatum are the mvps مجيب مراني
	George Tolik maybe his not explosive but jokic is a complete package, you can't find on any player right now.. his  IQ, his passing ability, his rebounding and he is scorer..
	I can’t wait to see the us olymoic dream team to destroy every opponent with 30 or 40 points in Paris after that nba is interesting again my friend …مجيب مراني I
	George Tolik nah !! Last Worldcup 2023 the USA has full NBA player in their line up.. but got kicked out by germany with only 4 NBA player 😂
	مجيب مراني because the USA team play with not the best players and other countries play with the best players that’s the readon
	Modest doubt is called the beacon of the wise.
	STAY HEALTHY OKC⚡⚡⚡⚡
	❤️🇺🇸💪

	Dennis Skief What was the Clippers record yesterday, dipshit?
	Justin Brooke what the fuck do the clippers have to do with my comment fuktard?
	Dennis Skief OKC just stomped the Clippers yesterday.  You out here acting like okc isn't good because they played a bad team tonight.
	Don't get mad at me because your team's sucked ass for twenty years.
	Justin Brooke listen idiot. I was laughing at the Wizards record period end.of story. You're the goofball that misinterpreted my comment and tagged me with your ignorant reply. Only to find out you're dead fucking wrong. Stick yourself 🤡
	Dennis Skief well, my bad.  I'm used to all these haters trashing the Thunder.  Saying the same regurgitated cas bullshit as every other geek.  Calm down, bro.  It's the internet.
	Justin Brooke suck steel and swallow fuktard. Go debate with your friend if you have any.
	Dennis Skief Eat a dick, bozo.  Who shit in your cereal?
