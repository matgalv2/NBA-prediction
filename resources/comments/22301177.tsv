TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	And They Only Won By 3🤔🤔 So if Ja was playing the outcome really woulda been different🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
	20x All Star Appearance⭐ 
	4x Championship ring💍
	Currently in 21st season, 39 years old, averaged 25.2 Points 7.5 rebounds 7.0 assists this season.
	nuggets vs celtics finals🔥 denver champs🏆
	Don't get me wrong but Lakers will be the champion.
	Lakers barely beat a depleted Memphis team?  Should be a cause for concern.  Sure, a good win for LAL, but folks need to quit posting nonsense like the West is afraid of the Lakers ... NOT.  Sure, teams shouldn't overlook the Lakers, but if anything, LA need to be concerned if they face a fully healthy Nuggets or T-Wolves, depending on how they do in the play in.  OKC is tough too, but LAL could match up better with them.
	😂 😂
	😁.
	The charge? There was no charge. The refs gave them the game. Period.
	That HUGE three point win against a Memphis G-League team...
	Still loving the game and having fun....Just look at his face and body language
	💀💀
	Jacobe Tyler Well said....How do you hate someone that's never been in ANY TROUBLE? Not even a parking ticket..
	Will Will facts
	Will Will wow he has time to smile after all those baby tears
	Jesse Pascal Keeps you watching and talking about him so he's renting space in your mind...King James!
	Jesse Pascal You need some Kleenex?? You felt the need to criticize....Grow up
	Celebrating a move to eight seed by a team that supposedly has the greatest player of all time is so unimpressive it's probably better not to mention it at all.
	The Los Angeles Refs Doing They Thang…
	I'll stick to pro wrestling at least they admit they're rigged
	Ruben Ramirez at this point I've stopped watching
	They beat a team missing 13 players by 3 🥴
	As a life long Laker fan, I actually enjoyed watching the Grizzlies play.. especially Scotty Pippin Jr.  Glad the Lakers won, but kudos to the way the Grizzlies played!  It reminded me how our squad played and won against the Bucks without LeBron and AD!
	Congrats. But still MJ is the 🐐 Greatest of all time and Kobe is the Greatest laker ever.
	the only way left for 8th seed is lakers win last game while GSW and sacramento lose at least once
	Kevin Gecobe If Lakers wins his last, they'll be 8th. GSW and Kings lost las night
	Valentin Cambiano yeah saw that. Now it doesnt matter whoever wins on GSW vs Kings. IF lakers win  their next game, then they will secure 8th seed. If lakers lose, they will be 9th seed. Actually they needed to win their last game since its their ticket for the lower bracket. If they lose, their fight will be on the upper bracket against nuggets lol
	Great Game Memphis TenAKey
	King Abdullah Diallo reasons?
	Alexis Ohno Because Lebron and the lakers where just imy City
	The Bron-AD duo had to score 73 points just to get a 3-point win against the Memphis Hustle 😩😭💀🤣
	When are we going to all agree King James is the best player to play the game 🏀 honestly man look at it. 
	Olajuwon Hunter
	They will drop to no 10 in 2 days lol
	Ok..I mean OKC have the tie breaker against Wolves and Nuggets
	Nik Drick ok..
	He didn’t walk out from this game then
	Edit: The refs lead the Lakers to a victory. ✌🏾
	We won, but our defense was absolutely not there for us tonight. Horrendous, horrendous defense. Here's hoping when they do make it into the play-offs, defensive hustle does kick in no matter what hare-brained scheme/rotation Darvin Ham cooks up
	King James is him da best player ever played the game HUGE Win
	👋 How are you I hope you're doing well..I really want to talk to you about we are not friends yet and I try it several times but it's can't send you a friend request can you please send me a friend request so that we can talk and know more about each other if you don't mind..I wish you all luck 😘😘🙏🙏
	Vickia Bobby i dont use fb mostly on X or Instagram also why we should be friends gimme 1 good reason stranger?
	Igor Poslon 3 point win is NOT a huge win buddy.
	Eddy Luna but its still a win i am not your buddy stranger get a grip
	Igor Poslon got it pal
	Igor Poslon I do have a life amigo
	Wow you beat a team with 27 wins! Congratulations! 🙄
	Robert Fisher just like spurs beats the nuggets in a comeback win?
	"Ericben B. Amay no. This discussion isn't about either of those teams. Denver are the defending champs, they don't need to worry about being in the ""play in"" game, which was created for Mr. Flopper. If Adam Silver had any say, he will direct his refs to continue to give leniency to the Lakers. I can't stand what the NBA is today. Also, the Lakers, for the 4th consecutive year, are a mediocre team with a legendary stat player of 21 yrs due to HGH and PEDs. C'mon."
	🤷 Try to use peds if you can score 40pts 12 rebs 14 assist at 39.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Ericben B. Amay dude. You're delusional. Love the excuse blah blah blah, but they were the 7th seed. They created the play in FOR LeBron. Just like the constant non calls for travelling. That's a whole other subject. They're currently the 8th seed, wow. IF they get past their play in game, they'll get bounced in the first 7 game series. How sad for such a storied franchise, 4th straight season of mediocre play and playoffs. LeBron gets his numbers to stuff his stat sheet because, well, that's important , to him. That's all he cares about. I've never seen a so-called team captain walk off the court before the game is over. Oh that's right, he only does that when they lose. He's a great player at 39 because of PED HGH and how training has changed. We're so lucky in LA, not.
	34 free throws vs 21. Win: Lakers. MVP: Refs.
	John Richardson move on. Watch the game again and again. You're crying because gsw back at 10th spot again? 😭😭
	Jerwin, couldn’t care less about the Warriors. The Lakers have shot 3 TIMES as many free throws as the number two team on the free throw differential rankings. It’s not favoritism, it’s cheating.
	Lebron is all the lakers have. They don't have any other good players.  Lebron never has had any good help on any of his teams.
	When the “NBA” wants you in the playoffs the NBA will get you in the playoff.
	Austin Watkins : Enjoy The Show.
	Lebron and lakers fans should be ashamed. Y’all glorifying this win 😂😂😂😂😂
	Wow they barely beat a losing team!
	Leading the charge in barely winning over a hapless Grizzlies team missing 13 players to help improve their Play-In Tournament standing....WOOOO or something.
	Oh yes, another post about the Lakers, who are 8th in the West.
	Antonis Papadimitriou
	The GOAT is still showing impressive numbers, hail to the King!
	Number 8 can't beat the number 1 to 7 😁😁😁
	One more to go 2 remain at #8.  Their biggest game of the year.  A loss could drop them to #10 at worse. Go Lakers!
	We almost lost to a G league squad!!
	They beat the 3rd/g-league unit of Memphis by 3?
	That Reverse Dunk 😉
	Noel B Golez
	Bring on the pelicans tomorrow ESPN
	💜💛👊
	Nuggets will sweep lebron
	Let's go Lakers your great team
	im pretty sure lakers will become the first team to win in season tournament championship and nba championship in the same season comeon lets be honest no one can beat lakers in a 7 game series with goat lebron and AD as the best duo in the league leading this championship roster carry on🔥
	What a shame... the proclaimed king is happy finishing 8th at last call game in order to get to the playoffs.Man man man,the world of basketball is really crazy this days .
	Congratulations 🎉
	lezzgo Lakers 💜💛 last 1 game vs. pelicans
	Refs helped the lakers win this game, just like they did against the pacers.
	"Lebron haters - "" They barely beat the G-league Memphis"" "
	Play in team fir the win hahhahah you guys are silly
	G LEAGUE? SERIOUSLY?
	Lefloppy is such a goat that he only has 5 more wins than the Houston Rockets 🤣🤣🤣🤣 #whatajoke
	2024 WCF The Los Angeles Lakers. Memba mi tell yuh dat!!
	Sometimes teams play better with young guys. That Memphis team play very well a lot of three pointers
	De aron Fox and Curry intentionally choked their must win game just to avoid the lakers in the play-in. They would rather face each other than to face the wrath of the goat and his lakers in the play-in. Smart move tho by Curry and Fox. All facts ✅💯👑🐐
	Good Work lolo bron👍
	That’s great and all but they’re not playing good basketball right now and this is the worst time to be mediocre
	THE GREATEST FOREVER !!! ❤️
	Congrats Idol💪👑Road to #7 seed.
	Appreciate this man, oldest in the league but still dominating in numbers 😎
	I hope lakers be the champions 💗💗💗
	Lbj is insane
	let's go Lakers!💪
	Lakers win
	won by 3 against a G-league team 🤡
	They beat a team with no starters available by 3...then hype all the way
	Oh congrats you beat a team that plays way under 500
	That's who you want to represent  the NBA, his attitude  and leadership  sucks , maybe he should stop and reflect on what he is teaching the younger athletes,  and his kids ,what a man
	Nuggets to the finals
	Too many lakers hater 😂 lol. 2 type of lakers hater .😂😂
	So in other words, had they lost this game, and their final upcoming game, they wouldn't be in the playoffs. How pathetic.
	It was a bad Memphis team with no Ja Morant that you beat 🙄
	Oh wow, beat an injury decimated grizzlies team with a bunch of role players and bench warmers. And the Lakers starting 5 beat them by 3. Big hype 💩
	Good day for us lakers nation!
	Memphis had half the team on injury and they are a below 500 team! If you didn’t win then there would be something to talk about..
	Should be technical for taunting at the end live play  … free throw and a ball with time remaining
	He lead the charge with 1 more point and 5 less rebounds than Davis 😂😂😂
	Sure the NBA commissioner and the refs are going to see that the Lakers get there.
	Oooh! #8! Wow! 
	Go refs!
	Warriors fans are not worried, they still have Denver and Boston up their sleeves!
	3 points win for Lakers
	So AD had better stats, but LeBron “lead the charge”? 😂 ok
	Still need to win the final game to avoid a play in match
	GOAT James, no other athlete has ever replicated this level of consistency and longevity. 20 straight seasons with no less than 25/6/6 no less than a 50% eFG or 55% TS. No other player has come close to matching that. Maybe Karl Malone and to a lesser extent Kareem, Kobe and KD (weir all 4 are K names).
	34 free throw compared to 21 free throw helping with a 3 point win - destiny or designed outcome 🤔
	10 games out of first with 1 game left in the season...... yeah they did great
	Not really.  It all depends on whether the Pelicans want to win on Sunday.
	What a joke of a win... Team STINKS!!
	All these haters commenting on LeBron, even after a great game (37/9/5), but make no mention of Steph missing yet another game winner, while still in the 9th seed, but yall always give little light skin a pass, because y’all like him.#Hypocrites🤡
	He isn't the best player Michael Kobe why is he playing this long so he can break records most points what else if you are winning championship while breaking these records fine
	Yet they only beat the Grizzlies by 3 points 😂If there was no playin, they wouldn’t be in the playoffs.  Don’t worry, they’ll be done soon 😂
	Bron is great no complaints no criticism
	Hey they finally won a game woo hoo
	this shouldn't have been a close game against this team especially if you're talking about winning a championship
	This game is history. Sunday night's game against the Pelicans will determine who has the right to brag!
	LeFlop can thank the NBA for allowing PED cheating and letting the refs favour the Los Angeles Lakers. 
	The Lakers. Getting excited about an 8 seed.      Should tell you everything.         Magic is laughing
	39 still doin it.. if MJ wasnt such a ball hog he'd have these career numbers. But he wanted to feed himself n ego and not his team
	A win is a win but Lakers fans must be very upset and worried now.
	The Western conference playoff games will be the most entertaining to watch
	all you people knocking on lebron jordan doesnt win 6 rings  if bron would have been on them cavs teams back in the day
	Old, but still carrying his team. 😅
	They win all him. They lose blame everyone but him. This dudes ego is unreal.
	🤦🏾‍♂️.. can’t have Lebron James miss the playoffs 😒
	They needed to cheat with an extra minute  to beat a depleted squad.
	The NBA gave them an extra minute to win 😂
	Barely beat a bad team without their star.
	Davis the king of lakers
	grizzles they are fine in the west right...its so so so fine in the west..
	I know you have a tough Game against the Pels today and they are On Fire all Cylinders!
	They beat a time with 27 wins.   What a joke
	Too bad Marvs are winning it this year.
	You are my sunshine-
	Let's go warriors for the 10th seed 😆
	What ever result of the Lakers last game, they'll still be in the play-in😂
	They beat a team with only 3 points when most of their entire roaster is on the injury list 😭
	So I could be the greatest basketball player if I only compete against mediocre teams? 
	great LBJ
	OKC for the champs
	He is doing everything to avoid Steph Curry.😝
	Wow they were without 13 players
	They only won bcuz spj went out with an eye injury
	Only to get swept by the Nuggets in the first round 🥴😂
	Beat the Memphis Cubs
	AD had better stats but somehow LBJ is the highlighted player! Hmmmm
	37 points. Could have did more.
	The West is going to be tougher Nxt year
	They won by 3 against a team that's horrible and ja didn't even play lol
	Luckily Ja wasn’t playing 😉
	Almost a triple double. 37 points, 9 rebounds, 8 turnovers
	Grizzlies vs the refs for sure
	Laker's embarassing win against a depleted Grizzlies lineup. Should be a 20+ difference not a miserable 3 pts.🤣🤣🤣
	lakers win gsw choke what a day today hahaha
	The King 🔥 ❤️❤️❤️
	Looks like Davis lead the team not LeFlop. So when did 8th place become a bragging right?
	Wow! They beat the Grizzlies JV team by 3 to clinch the 8th seed. Elite. 🤣
	Zebras beat the games
	Still going to love watching them implode come playoffs.
	Lakeshow💜💛
	WE SALUTE YOU KING JAMES
	If they can barely beat the Grizzlies 
	thats a big deal they won by 3pts.
	I never bet against bron in the playoffs 
	It’s the grizzlies
	11 for lebron and 15 from AD
	Trying to avoid the Dubs. Great call.
	NBA keep ruined itself
	Led the charge against 8 G league players 😆 what a king 😂
	46-35 MJ WOULD NEVER 😆 🤣
	Needed an extra minute to win that game. Had keep to the script 🤣 must be Democraps😎
	Beat a 27-54 team by 3 points without Ja wow impressive!!
	I can see the last ring 💍 #Lebron ✌🏿
	Wow....all this hype and importance on the line and the best they can do is squeak by the worst team in basketball??? LOLOLOLOLOLOL....
	Is there any in the history of NBA at the age of 39 do what can Lebron do?
	Where is morant
	lmao 8th seed great job
	A win is a win😛
	Wow they beat Memphis.
	If Lakers win LeBronze lead them? If Lakers lost it's teammates FAULT? LeBronze has no help?
	Lakers games are rigged.
	They beat the G-league team by 3?
	Brian Leigh halos tibuok roster wla coach tayy
	Lakers against the worst team of course 😎
	Nice win congratulations Lakers 👏💪👑🐐
	All that to beat Memphis 😭😭 ok
	So now the lakers win but they only show Lebran wait till they lose
	Anthony Davis was the x factor. He had the highest gm score
	Why was this game this close????????
	Lakers referee free throw team of NBA
	Keep it up, attack the rim 🔥
	Congratulations Lakers 🏀🏆
	almost lost to a grizz college team
	lakers win versus team rosters' 13 player out
	Los Angeles Lakers Vs Memphis Grizzlies
	By stats , AD should of had player of the game
	Without AD LeBron would be nothing.  AD should get the praise.  Not bullyball, cry baby flopper James.
	Lebron James
	Dude is a beast and at 39 years old bro. That's insane!!!
	Memphis fell off hard 
	Haters hate this 😅
	Lebron hates that team 😂
	It is a W! No matter what you say 😁.
	j'ai JAMES 🏀
	Big win for Lakers
	What's up with this high scoring games.
	So powerful against that GLeague team tho
	Thank you refs 😊
	Lebron Lames
	Yes My team  Lakers
	Keep pushing, soon you’ll be the Goat, or not!
	Amazing for a 39er 💛💜😁
	Let's go championship 👑LeBron James 💜💛💪
	Has LeBron ever missed the playoffs?
	It’s Ham who won the game 🤪😜😝
	Another stress day for LeBron haters 😂
	How many travels did the self-proclaimed greatest player ever have in this game?
	Mandel, do you always post ironic comments?
	Christopher, tears of laughter for each delusional comment posted by James fans.
	Wow beat a 27 win team by 3 points to JUMP to #8 what a great accomplishment
	Wow , number 8 . What an accomplishment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	This guy hates the Grizzlies fr
	Barley won to the Timberwolves 🤣 definitely getting swept 1st round again
	hate him but gave him respect
	AD did just as much can't just say leclown lead the way
	Just rooting for the Lakers isn't rooting for James because he's not a good leader, and he needs to give up his spot because he's just a hugger to win.
	Try not to be on the 8th seed or else its another sweep from the nuggets
	All that to beat the Grizzlies by 3 points 😂
	The only won by 3?!?!?!?
	Holy smokes….they beat a 27-54 team….impressive
	Only to face the Nuggets in the first round
	Stop showing me Lakers bud
	A blind squirrel finds an acorn once in awhile!!!!
	Keep it up la
	They got a Picture of him not crying, that's great
	Bravo 📌
	We believe 
	Old man still teaching these kids how to ball? 😂 Man I love this
	You are proud of the fact that you beat a 13th place short-handed bottom of the league team by three points?
	They beat a 27-54 team about as exciting as that in season tournament title, and yet they only won by 3 points.
	The Beardman🧔James is back💪
	Amen they cheat for the lak
	Always fighting for the last spot 😂
	Good job
	Check out the ft attempts
	With the GLeague line up 🤣
	Davis: 36 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists
	you're my sunshine
	ONYA KING JAMES THANKS MATE !¡!
	SPJ is a Beast
	A champion ring
	Los Angeles Lakers players really need to understand that they are waiting for a 39 years old father to win them games, can't they atleast hustle in defence ?
	🤩
	Norjanah Abulkhair I told you diba may himala AHAHAHHA
	Lakers and Bucks in the Finals
	❤️LBJ
	The fact you guys braggg .. jumps to 8th in the West 🤪🤣

	Amazing game
	Laos n di n ksulod s final
	Old is gold
	LEANTHONY JAVIS!!!🤣💀
	Davis lead the WAY 🥺
	age of 39
	Loving the game 🥇🏅
	Against the lowly grizzlies.. and they only won by 3..
	34 free throws needed against a team missing 13 people and still barely won.
	Who needs their driver’s license or CDL,
	Amazing what he can do when he chooses to play because it’s a lottery team. 😂
	Stats look like AD shoulda been pictured.
	nice Lolobron
	Itold you guys Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	go lakers!!
	Come on boys 🔥
	Barely won against the G League Grizzlies
	"Memphis went from ""I'm fine in the west"" to a 27-54 record."
	Diva
	Love it
	Good game from lebron.. people are sleeping on cam withmore. Theres always 1 late pick thats making it big.
	How many flops
	So the referees gave them the game because the commissioner wants his golden child into the playoffs... 
	Aging like fine wine📸❤️
	8th place!  😜😂
	They squeaked by a bunch of cashiers and car salesmen. Memphis was holding open tryouts at the Forum last week. LeBum coughed the ball up 8 times against dudes who sleep on their moms couch and still owe two payments on the shoes they played with.
	The man with 36 14 and 5 and 2 blks sounds like the charge leader ….
	How many flops
	Beat up on a weak team nice job
	Against the G League boys and almost choke out!!!
	Congratulations u beat a sorry team🤣
	The Lakers are a one and done team
	I love this man so much
	Job 8:20
	Playing for their life and beat the #13th team by a bucket. Someonrs not doing much leading
	Wow they beat a crappy team, congrats.  They won a game they were supposed too!!!!
	Congratulation LAKERS....❤❤❤
	Fixed for Lestat Paddler
	LAL, any chances for Playoff?
	Lebron is NOT THAT great just ok and he's NO king either!!!
	They should have won
	This is a man who won’t lose to anyone.
	Lebron! The goat and king!!!
	Hope they play the Suns in play in game so we can knock them out AGAIN. Will be the 3rd time in 4 years I believe lol
	Palestinian kids deserve life too 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️🕊️🥰🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️✌️✌️✌️🥰
	You’re bragging about being an 8th seed, and beating a team with a terrible record… this is the “excellence” the nba brings to the table these days.
	Good win queen 👑
	Celebrating 8th place! LOL
	Free Palestine 🇵🇸🥰🥰🕊️🕊️🇵🇸
	Barely beat a team with no starters 🤣🤣🤣🤣 can't wait to watch this clown get swept outta the playoffs AGAIN
	Thanks to Adam silver &amp; referees🐭👑🤡💩 let’s Fire Ham🤣🤣🤣
	Hit me up let’s stack up 💪🏽💰💯
	Really.... LeBron always plays bottom feeders, and yall act like he really did something. It was MEMPHIS!  and they're still only on 8th place! 🙄🙄🙄
	Marvin Jones so the 70 games he played this year so far are all bottom feeders I take it
	Richard Rodgers No. But when he does load manage,  you can guarantee he will play the bottom teams to pad them stats!
	somebody not happy🤣😂
	#Lakeshow💜💛🔥🤜🤛🏀
	All that just to beat the grizz?? Someone's getting blown out early in the playoffs...
	James made some toast this morning. Where's the post about that?

	Against Memphis. James faked injuries when they play real teams. The Grizzlies are 26-50.
	Harnel Kein
	He always makes sure to play in the games where teams have a losing record. 27 and 54. And the grizzlys were without 13 players.Lol. Way to shine LeChump

	No it was the refs lakers were terrible but like always the refs take them to the free-throws thay had twice as much as the other team .

	20x All Star Appearance⭐ 
	Once again. NO DEFENSE.
	To jump to 8th, wow, great accomplishment 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
	Considering that Griz didn't play none of their starters it was a gift to LeBron.
	Eeeeeeyyyyyy
	Lol. ADs stats is more impresive than that. Plus AD had +2 while lebum only had -3. 😂

	3 pts lead without Ja…. 🤪🤪😜
	I mean then didn’t AD lead the charge lol
	Pretty good against plumper teams
	Why not report on the top teams- LeFlop not worthy of news—4-6 in championship games
	Ooh boy beat a team with 27 wins
	thank you referee 🤣
	Don't get me wrong but Lakers will be the champion.
	LaFlop will FLOP
	Meanwhile the fear of the Joker lingers in his mind
	Please let them play the Nuggets again this year!!  😂
