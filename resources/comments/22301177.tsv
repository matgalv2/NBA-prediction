TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAL	And They Only Won By 3🤔🤔 So if Ja was playing the outcome really woulda been different🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
LAL	20x All Star Appearance⭐
LAL	4x Championship ring💍
LAL	Currently in 21st season, 39 years old, averaged 25.2 Points 7.5 rebounds 7.0 assists this season.
	nuggets vs celtics finals🔥 denver champs🏆
LAL	Don't get me wrong but Lakers will be the champion.
LAL	Lakers barely beat a depleted Memphis team?  Should be a cause for concern.  Sure, a good win for LAL, but folks need to quit posting nonsense like the West is afraid of the Lakers ... NOT.  Sure, teams shouldn't overlook the Lakers, but if anything, LA need to be concerned if they face a fully healthy Nuggets or T-Wolves, depending on how they do in the play in.  OKC is tough too, but LAL could match up better with them.
	😂 😂
	😁.
LAL	The charge? There was no charge. The refs gave them the game. Period.
LAL	That HUGE three point win against a Memphis G-League team...
LAL	Still loving the game and having fun....Just look at his face and body language
	💀💀
	Jacobe Tyler Well said....How do you hate someone that's never been in ANY TROUBLE? Not even a parking ticket..
	Will Will facts
LAL	Will Will wow he has time to smile after all those baby tears
LAL	Jesse Pascal Keeps you watching and talking about him so he's renting space in your mind...King James!
	Jesse Pascal You need some Kleenex?? You felt the need to criticize....Grow up
LAL	Celebrating a move to eight seed by a team that supposedly has the greatest player of all time is so unimpressive it's probably better not to mention it at all.
LAL	The Los Angeles Refs Doing They Thang…
LAL	I'll stick to pro wrestling at least they admit they're rigged
	Ruben Ramirez at this point I've stopped watching
LAL	They beat a team missing 13 players by 3 🥴
MEM	As a life long Laker fan, I actually enjoyed watching the Grizzlies play.. especially Scotty Pippin Jr.  Glad the Lakers won, but kudos to the way the Grizzlies played!  It reminded me how our squad played and won against the Bucks without LeBron and AD!
LAL	Congrats. But still MJ is the 🐐 Greatest of all time and Kobe is the Greatest laker ever.
	the only way left for 8th seed is lakers win last game while GSW and sacramento lose at least once
	Kevin Gecobe If Lakers wins his last, they'll be 8th. GSW and Kings lost las night
	Valentin Cambiano yeah saw that. Now it doesnt matter whoever wins on GSW vs Kings. IF lakers win  their next game, then they will secure 8th seed. If lakers lose, they will be 9th seed. Actually they needed to win their last game since its their ticket for the lower bracket. If they lose, their fight will be on the upper bracket against nuggets lol
	Great Game Memphis TenAKey
	King Abdullah Diallo reasons?
	Alexis Ohno Because Lebron and the lakers where just imy City
LAL	The Bron-AD duo had to score 73 points just to get a 3-point win against the Memphis Hustle 😩😭💀🤣
LAL	When are we going to all agree King James is the best player to play the game 🏀 honestly man look at it.
	Olajuwon Hunter
LAL	They will drop to no 10 in 2 days lol
	Ok..I mean OKC have the tie breaker against Wolves and Nuggets
	Nik Drick ok..
	He didn’t walk out from this game then
LAL	Edit: The refs lead the Lakers to a victory. ✌🏾
LAL	We won, but our defense was absolutely not there for us tonight. Horrendous, horrendous defense. Here's hoping when they do make it into the play-offs, defensive hustle does kick in no matter what hare-brained scheme/rotation Darvin Ham cooks up
LAL	King James is him da best player ever played the game HUGE Win
	👋 How are you I hope you're doing well..I really want to talk to you about we are not friends yet and I try it several times but it's can't send you a friend request can you please send me a friend request so that we can talk and know more about each other if you don't mind..I wish you all luck 😘😘🙏🙏
	Vickia Bobby i dont use fb mostly on X or Instagram also why we should be friends gimme 1 good reason stranger?
	Igor Poslon 3 point win is NOT a huge win buddy.
	Eddy Luna but its still a win i am not your buddy stranger get a grip
	Igor Poslon got it pal
	Igor Poslon I do have a life amigo
LAL	Wow you beat a team with 27 wins! Congratulations! 🙄
	Robert Fisher just like spurs beats the nuggets in a comeback win?
	"Ericben B. Amay no. This discussion isn't about either of those teams. Denver are the defending champs, they don't need to worry about being in the ""play in"" game, which was created for Mr. Flopper. If Adam Silver had any say, he will direct his refs to continue to give leniency to the Lakers. I can't stand what the NBA is today. Also, the Lakers, for the 4th consecutive year, are a mediocre team with a legendary stat player of 21 yrs due to HGH and PEDs. C'mon."
	🤷 Try to use peds if you can score 40pts 12 rebs 14 assist at 39.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
	Ericben B. Amay dude. You're delusional. Love the excuse blah blah blah, but they were the 7th seed. They created the play in FOR LeBron. Just like the constant non calls for travelling. That's a whole other subject. They're currently the 8th seed, wow. IF they get past their play in game, they'll get bounced in the first 7 game series. How sad for such a storied franchise, 4th straight season of mediocre play and playoffs. LeBron gets his numbers to stuff his stat sheet because, well, that's important , to him. That's all he cares about. I've never seen a so-called team captain walk off the court before the game is over. Oh that's right, he only does that when they lose. He's a great player at 39 because of PED HGH and how training has changed. We're so lucky in LA, not.
LAL	34 free throws vs 21. Win: Lakers. MVP: Refs.
	John Richardson move on. Watch the game again and again. You're crying because gsw back at 10th spot again? 😭😭
	Jerwin, couldn’t care less about the Warriors. The Lakers have shot 3 TIMES as many free throws as the number two team on the free throw differential rankings. It’s not favoritism, it’s cheating.
LAL	Lebron is all the lakers have. They don't have any other good players.  Lebron never has had any good help on any of his teams.
LAL	When the “NBA” wants you in the playoffs the NBA will get you in the playoff.
	Austin Watkins : Enjoy The Show.
LAL	Lebron and lakers fans should be ashamed. Y’all glorifying this win 😂😂😂😂😂
LAL	Wow they barely beat a losing team!
LAL	Leading the charge in barely winning over a hapless Grizzlies team missing 13 players to help improve their Play-In Tournament standing....WOOOO or something.
	Oh yes, another post about the Lakers, who are 8th in the West.
	Antonis Papadimitriou
LAL	The GOAT is still showing impressive numbers, hail to the King!
LAL	Number 8 can't beat the number 1 to 7 😁😁😁
LAL	One more to go 2 remain at #8.  Their biggest game of the year.  A loss could drop them to #10 at worse. Go Lakers!
LAL	We almost lost to a G league squad!!
LAL	They beat the 3rd/g-league unit of Memphis by 3?
LAL	That Reverse Dunk 😉
	Noel B Golez
	Bring on the pelicans tomorrow ESPN
LAL	💜💛👊
LAL	Nuggets will sweep lebron
	Let's go Lakers your great team
LAL	im pretty sure lakers will become the first team to win in season tournament championship and nba championship in the same season comeon lets be honest no one can beat lakers in a 7 game series with goat lebron and AD as the best duo in the league leading this championship roster carry on🔥
LAL	What a shame... the proclaimed king is happy finishing 8th at last call game in order to get to the playoffs.Man man man,the world of basketball is really crazy this days .
LAL	Congratulations 🎉
LAL	lezzgo Lakers 💜💛 last 1 game vs. pelicans
LAL	Refs helped the lakers win this game, just like they did against the pacers.
LAL	"Lebron haters - "" They barely beat the G-league Memphis"" "
	Play in team fir the win hahhahah you guys are silly
	G LEAGUE? SERIOUSLY?
	Lefloppy is such a goat that he only has 5 more wins than the Houston Rockets 🤣🤣🤣🤣 #whatajoke
	2024 WCF The Los Angeles Lakers. Memba mi tell yuh dat!!
LAL	Sometimes teams play better with young guys. That Memphis team play very well a lot of three pointers
	De aron Fox and Curry intentionally choked their must win game just to avoid the lakers in the play-in. They would rather face each other than to face the wrath of the goat and his lakers in the play-in. Smart move tho by Curry and Fox. All facts ✅💯👑🐐
LAL	Good Work lolo bron👍
LAL	That’s great and all but they’re not playing good basketball right now and this is the worst time to be mediocre
LAL	THE GREATEST FOREVER !!! ❤️
LAL	Congrats Idol💪👑Road to #7 seed.
	Appreciate this man, oldest in the league but still dominating in numbers 😎
LAL	I hope lakers be the champions 💗💗💗
LAL	Lbj is insane
LAL	let's go Lakers!💪
LAL	Lakers win
LAL	won by 3 against a G-league team 🤡
LAL	They beat a team with no starters available by 3...then hype all the way
LAL	Oh congrats you beat a team that plays way under 500
	That's who you want to represent  the NBA, his attitude  and leadership  sucks , maybe he should stop and reflect on what he is teaching the younger athletes,  and his kids ,what a man
	Nuggets to the finals
	Too many lakers hater 😂 lol. 2 type of lakers hater .😂😂
	So in other words, had they lost this game, and their final upcoming game, they wouldn't be in the playoffs. How pathetic.
MEM	It was a bad Memphis team with no Ja Morant that you beat 🙄
LAL	Oh wow, beat an injury decimated grizzlies team with a bunch of role players and bench warmers. And the Lakers starting 5 beat them by 3. Big hype 💩
LAL	Good day for us lakers nation!
MEM	Memphis had half the team on injury and they are a below 500 team! If you didn’t win then there would be something to talk about..
	Should be technical for taunting at the end live play  … free throw and a ball with time remaining
LAL	He lead the charge with 1 more point and 5 less rebounds than Davis 😂😂😂
	Sure the NBA commissioner and the refs are going to see that the Lakers get there.
LAL	Oooh! #8! Wow!
LAL	Go refs!
	Warriors fans are not worried, they still have Denver and Boston up their sleeves!
LAL	3 points win for Lakers
LAL	So AD had better stats, but LeBron “lead the charge”? 😂 ok
LAL	Still need to win the final game to avoid a play in match
LAL	GOAT James, no other athlete has ever replicated this level of consistency and longevity. 20 straight seasons with no less than 25/6/6 no less than a 50% eFG or 55% TS. No other player has come close to matching that. Maybe Karl Malone and to a lesser extent Kareem, Kobe and KD (weir all 4 are K names).
LAL	34 free throw compared to 21 free throw helping with a 3 point win - destiny or designed outcome 🤔
LAL	10 games out of first with 1 game left in the season...... yeah they did great
	Not really.  It all depends on whether the Pelicans want to win on Sunday.
LAL	What a joke of a win... Team STINKS!!
LAL	All these haters commenting on LeBron, even after a great game (37/9/5), but make no mention of Steph missing yet another game winner, while still in the 9th seed, but yall always give little light skin a pass, because y’all like him.#Hypocrites🤡
LAL	He isn't the best player Michael Kobe why is he playing this long so he can break records most points what else if you are winning championship while breaking these records fine
	Yet they only beat the Grizzlies by 3 points 😂If there was no playin, they wouldn’t be in the playoffs.  Don’t worry, they’ll be done soon 😂
LAL	Bron is great no complaints no criticism
LAL	Hey they finally won a game woo hoo
MEM	this shouldn't have been a close game against this team especially if you're talking about winning a championship
	This game is history. Sunday night's game against the Pelicans will determine who has the right to brag!
LAL	LeFlop can thank the NBA for allowing PED cheating and letting the refs favour the Los Angeles Lakers.
LAL	The Lakers. Getting excited about an 8 seed.      Should tell you everything.         Magic is laughing
LAL	39 still doin it.. if MJ wasnt such a ball hog he'd have these career numbers. But he wanted to feed himself n ego and not his team
LAL	A win is a win but Lakers fans must be very upset and worried now.
LAL	The Western conference playoff games will be the most entertaining to watch
	all you people knocking on lebron jordan doesnt win 6 rings  if bron would have been on them cavs teams back in the day
LAL	Old, but still carrying his team. 😅
LAL	They win all him. They lose blame everyone but him. This dudes ego is unreal.
LAL	🤦🏾‍♂️.. can’t have Lebron James miss the playoffs 😒
LAL	They needed to cheat with an extra minute  to beat a depleted squad.
LAL	The NBA gave them an extra minute to win 😂
LAL	Barely beat a bad team without their star.
LAL	Davis the king of lakers
MEM	grizzles they are fine in the west right...its so so so fine in the west..
	I know you have a tough Game against the Pels today and they are On Fire all Cylinders!
MEM	They beat a time with 27 wins.   What a joke
	Too bad Marvs are winning it this year.
	You are my sunshine-
	Let's go warriors for the 10th seed 😆
LAL	What ever result of the Lakers last game, they'll still be in the play-in😂
LAL	They beat a team with only 3 points when most of their entire roaster is on the injury list 😭
LAL	So I could be the greatest basketball player if I only compete against mediocre teams?
LAL	great LBJ
	OKC for the champs
LAL	He is doing everything to avoid Steph Curry.😝
MEM	Wow they were without 13 players
LAL	They only won bcuz spj went out with an eye injury
	Only to get swept by the Nuggets in the first round 🥴😂
	Beat the Memphis Cubs
LAL	AD had better stats but somehow LBJ is the highlighted player! Hmmmm
LAL	37 points. Could have did more.
	The West is going to be tougher Nxt year
LAL	They won by 3 against a team that's horrible and ja didn't even play lol
MEM	Luckily Ja wasn’t playing 😉
LAL	Almost a triple double. 37 points, 9 rebounds, 8 turnovers
LAL	Grizzlies vs the refs for sure
LAL	Laker's embarassing win against a depleted Grizzlies lineup. Should be a 20+ difference not a miserable 3 pts.🤣🤣🤣
LAL	lakers win gsw choke what a day today hahaha
LAL	The King 🔥 ❤️❤️❤️
LAL	Looks like Davis lead the team not LeFlop. So when did 8th place become a bragging right?
LAL	Wow! They beat the Grizzlies JV team by 3 to clinch the 8th seed. Elite. 🤣
	Zebras beat the games
	Still going to love watching them implode come playoffs.
LAL	Lakeshow💜💛
LAL	WE SALUTE YOU KING JAMES
LAL	If they can barely beat the Grizzlies
LAL	thats a big deal they won by 3pts.
LAL	I never bet against bron in the playoffs
MEM	It’s the grizzlies
LAL	11 for lebron and 15 from AD
LAL	Trying to avoid the Dubs. Great call.
	NBA keep ruined itself
LAL	Led the charge against 8 G league players 😆 what a king 😂
LAL	46-35 MJ WOULD NEVER 😆 🤣
	Needed an extra minute to win that game. Had keep to the script 🤣 must be Democraps😎
LAL	Beat a 27-54 team by 3 points without Ja wow impressive!!
LAL	I can see the last ring 💍 #Lebron ✌🏿
	Wow....all this hype and importance on the line and the best they can do is squeak by the worst team in basketball??? LOLOLOLOLOLOL....
LAL	Is there any in the history of NBA at the age of 39 do what can Lebron do?
MEM	Where is morant
	lmao 8th seed great job
	A win is a win😛
LAL	Wow they beat Memphis.
LAL	If Lakers win LeBronze lead them? If Lakers lost it's teammates FAULT? LeBronze has no help?
LAL	Lakers games are rigged.
LAL	They beat the G-league team by 3?
	Brian Leigh halos tibuok roster wla coach tayy
	Lakers against the worst team of course 😎
LAL	Nice win congratulations Lakers 👏💪👑🐐
LAL	All that to beat Memphis 😭😭 ok
LAL	So now the lakers win but they only show Lebran wait till they lose
LAL	Anthony Davis was the x factor. He had the highest gm score
LAL	Why was this game this close????????
	Lakers referee free throw team of NBA
LAL	Keep it up, attack the rim 🔥
LAL	Congratulations Lakers 🏀🏆
LAL	almost lost to a grizz college team
LAL	lakers win versus team rosters' 13 player out
	Los Angeles Lakers Vs Memphis Grizzlies
LAL	By stats , AD should of had player of the game
	Without AD LeBron would be nothing.  AD should get the praise.  Not bullyball, cry baby flopper James.
LAL	Lebron James
LAL	Dude is a beast and at 39 years old bro. That's insane!!!
MEM	Memphis fell off hard

LAL	Has LeBron ever missed the playoffs?
	It’s Ham who won the game 🤪😜😝
LAL	Another stress day for LeBron haters 😂
LAL	How many travels did the self-proclaimed greatest player ever have in this game?
	Mandel, do you always post ironic comments?
	Christopher, tears of laughter for each delusional comment posted by James fans.
LAL	Wow beat a 27 win team by 3 points to JUMP to #8 what a great accomplishment
LAL	Wow , number 8 . What an accomplishment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LAL	This guy hates the Grizzlies fr
LAL	Barley won to the Timberwolves 🤣 definitely getting swept 1st round again
LAL	hate him but gave him respect
LAL	AD did just as much can't just say leclown lead the way
LAL	Just rooting for the Lakers isn't rooting for James because he's not a good leader, and he needs to give up his spot because he's just a hugger to win.
	Try not to be on the 8th seed or else its another sweep from the nuggets
LAL	All that to beat the Grizzlies by 3 points 😂
LAL	The only won by 3?!?!?!?
LAL	Holy smokes….they beat a 27-54 team….impressive
	Only to face the Nuggets in the first round
	Stop showing me Lakers bud

LAL	Bravo 📌
	We believe 
LAL	Old man still teaching these kids how to ball? 😂 Man I love this
LAL	You are proud of the fact that you beat a 13th place short-handed bottom of the league team by three points?
LAL	They beat a 27-54 team about as exciting as that in season tournament title, and yet they only won by 3 points.
LAL	The Beardman🧔James is back💪
LAL	Amen they cheat for the lak
LAL	Always fighting for the last spot 😂
LAL	Good job

LAL	age of 39
LAL	Loving the game 🥇🏅
LAL	Against the lowly grizzlies.. and they only won by 3..
LAL	34 free throws needed against a team missing 13 people and still barely won.
	Who needs their driver’s license or CDL,
LAL	Amazing what he can do when he chooses to play because it’s a lottery team. 😂
LAL	Stats look like AD shoulda been pictured.
LAL	nice Lolobron
LAL	Itold you guys Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
LAL	go lakers!!
LAL	Come on boys 🔥
LAL	Barely won against the G League Grizzlies
MEM	"Memphis went from ""I'm fine in the west"" to a 27-54 record."
LAL	Diva
LAL	Love it
	Good game from lebron.. people are sleeping on cam withmore. Theres always 1 late pick thats making it big.
	How many flops
LAL	So the referees gave them the game because the commissioner wants his golden child into the playoffs...
LAL	Aging like fine wine📸❤️
LAL	8th place!  😜😂
	They squeaked by a bunch of cashiers and car salesmen. Memphis was holding open tryouts at the Forum last week. LeBum coughed the ball up 8 times against dudes who sleep on their moms couch and still owe two payments on the shoes they played with.
	The man with 36 14 and 5 and 2 blks sounds like the charge leader ….
	How many flops
	Beat up on a weak team nice job
	Against the G League boys and almost choke out!!!
	Congratulations u beat a sorry team🤣
LAL	The Lakers are a one and done team
LAL	I love this man so much
	Job 8:20
LAL	Playing for their life and beat the #13th team by a bucket. Someonrs not doing much leading
LAL	Wow they beat a crappy team, congrats.  They won a game they were supposed too!!!!
LAL	Congratulation LAKERS....❤❤❤
	Fixed for Lestat Paddler
	LAL, any chances for Playoff?
LAL	Lebron is NOT THAT great just ok and he's NO king either!!!
MEM	They should have won
LAL	This is a man who won’t lose to anyone.
LAL	Lebron! The goat and king!!!
LAL	Hope they play the Suns in play in game so we can knock them out AGAIN. Will be the 3rd time in 4 years I believe lol
	Palestinian kids deserve life too 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️🕊️🥰🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️✌️✌️✌️🥰
LAL	You’re bragging about being an 8th seed, and beating a team with a terrible record… this is the “excellence” the nba brings to the table these days.
LAL	Good win queen 👑
LAL	Celebrating 8th place! LOL
	Free Palestine 🇵🇸🥰🥰🕊️🕊️🇵🇸
LAL	Barely beat a team with no starters 🤣🤣🤣🤣 can't wait to watch this clown get swept outta the playoffs AGAIN
	Thanks to Adam silver &amp; referees🐭👑🤡💩 let’s Fire Ham🤣🤣🤣
	Hit me up let’s stack up 💪🏽💰💯
LAL	Really.... LeBron always plays bottom feeders, and yall act like he really did something. It was MEMPHIS!  and they're still only on 8th place! 🙄🙄🙄
	Marvin Jones so the 70 games he played this year so far are all bottom feeders I take it
	Richard Rodgers No. But when he does load manage,  you can guarantee he will play the bottom teams to pad them stats!
	somebody not happy🤣😂
LAL	#Lakeshow💜💛🔥🤜🤛🏀
	All that just to beat the grizz?? Someone's getting blown out early in the playoffs...
	James made some toast this morning. Where's the post about that?

	Luke Smith

LAL	Against Memphis. James faked injuries when they play real teams. The Grizzlies are 26-50.
	Harnel Kein
LAL	He always makes sure to play in the games where teams have a losing record. 27 and 54. And the grizzlys were without 13 players.Lol. Way to shine LeChump

	To jump to 8th, wow, great accomplishment 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
MEM	Considering that Griz didn't play none of their starters it was a gift to LeBron.
	Eeeeeeyyyyyy
LAL	Lol. ADs stats is more impresive than that. Plus AD had +2 while lebum only had -3. 😂
	Entrepreneurship isn’t easy, just like protesting when you don’t have clue of what’s going on... That’s why I encourage people to passively do something spectacular..... in case you’re seeking for an option on how to make money online, get in touch with..
