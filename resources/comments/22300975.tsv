	Ŵhat a great win. Knicks did a good job defending Sabonis throughout the whole game
	 the refs gave them that game all I say is fouls all game not being called can’t wait for them to play again in NY
	 not salty at all good win for you guys the knicks got a great team they might have a chance the do something this year
	Very impressed by their defense recently
	 recently?  Foh
	The Kings only hooping against the Lakers LOL
	So he had 42pts and 3 steals. Those were his stats this game
	 ok 🤷🏾‍♂️
	That was a really good game. Refs let them play for most the part, was pretty surprised.
	
	
	Felt like I was watching a 90s game.
	They are almost at full squad. OG back, wait til Randle and Robinson gets back. They are going to be dangerous, especially with those new additions of Burk and Bojan.
	That is the type of defense we need in all NBA games! We done with the GenZs!
	Game was intense. Kings will get them back in NY.
	I thought we were done with the 90s haahhha
	Huge win and our defense been nasty we need that 3rd seed so we can see the Celtics in the ECF or rest up and get that 6th seed once they lock up a playoff spot
	Let's Go.  My KNICKS ain't trying to sneak into the Playoffs this year. 🏀🔥
	 still wont win shyt 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
	 just like Brooklyn And your No Days off Heat 🤣
	 I ain't hear 'No days off' OR 'New Mecca' the Whole Season 🤷🤣🤣🤣
	 Just like i hear from tricks fans every 10 yrs and still dont win squat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗽🔫
	 I ain't ever say we gonna win.  That's you.  2 teams that Suck 🤣🤣🤣
	Let’s go NYKnicks
	They didn’t light the Beam tonight.
	I love coach of NY he loves game defense like 80's and 90's game
	So they can beat the kings but bucks can’t lol 🤦🏾‍♂️
	🧡💙
	Tough win
	Great win😍
	Go Kings!
	How tf the Knicks can win but the Lakers couldn’t?
	 cuz the Knicks are good and the lakers aren’t
	 my comment is to emphasize the Lakers is bad
	Got the DUB my boy JB KILLING THINGS!!
	💯
	
	
	
	
	Celtics are the 1 seed but the Knicks are the team nobody wants to play in the playoffs. That defense is crazy.
	Wish he was still in dallas 😪
	Sacramento have form like a yoyo, up down up
	Warriors beat lakers 128-121.
	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
	I don't remember the last time I saw kings scoring less than 100
	He score Half of Knicks points, selfish player 🤣
	Sabonis is not clutch
	42 out of 98 team points is crazyyyyyyyy . respect JB!!!😎😎😎😎😎😎
	My Vintage Knicks  💙 🧡
