TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Ŵhat a great win. Knicks did a good job defending Sabonis throughout the whole game
	Surge Wrangler the refs gave them that game all I say is fouls all game not being called can’t wait for them to play again in NY
	🤣 kings had 26 FT attempts compared to the Knicks 14 FT attempts but yep the refs gave the Knicks the game
	Malachi Butts not salty at all good win for you guys the knicks got a great team they might have a chance the do something this year
	Jesus Lugo Valenzuela  real quick what was the free throw differential? 
	26 Free Throw attempts to 16 free throw attempts by the Knicks.
	Jesus Lugo Valenzuela so then why did SAC have TEN more free throws in this game ?
	Surge Wrangler shut him down in the second half, wasn't looking great in the first half
	Top 3 mvp should be contenders, kawhi sga brunson and luka for that 3rd spot.
	The Kings only hooping against the Lakers LOL
	Hilmi Firdaus and the bucks, and the nuggets, and the suns, and the Thunder…you don’t watch much Kings basketball
	Very impressed by their defense recently
	Jacob Barnes recently?  Foh
	So he had 42pts and 3 steals. Those were his stats this game
	🤷🏾‍♂️
	Jim Maxis Jimbo I'm being sarcastic because 3pm is such a stupid addition to the stat line
	Liu Geng Geng
	Excellent Wei
	That was a really good game. Refs let them play for most the part, was pretty surprised.
	Felt like I was watching a 90s game.
	Allan Poston u didn’t just say that
	They are almost at full squad. OG back, wait til Randle and Robinson gets back. They are going to be dangerous, especially with those new additions of Burk and Bojan.
	I thought we were done with the 90s haahhha
	That is the type of defense we need in all NBA games! We done with the GenZs!
	Game was intense. Kings will get them back in NY.
	Huge win and our defense been nasty we need that 3rd seed so we can see the Celtics in the ECF or rest up and get that 6th seed once they lock up a playoff spot
	Let’s go NYKnicks
	They didn’t light the Beam tonight.
	Let's Go.  My KNICKS ain't trying to sneak into the Playoffs this year. 🏀🔥
	I love coach of NY he loves game defense like 80's and 90's game
	So they can beat the kings but bucks can’t lol 🤦🏾‍♂️

	Great win😍
	Tough win
	🧡💙
	Go Kings!
	Ok yan aangat ang Suns
	How tf the Knicks can win but the Lakers couldn’t?
	Khoi Anh Nguyen cuz the Knicks are good and the lakers aren’t
	Khoi Anh Nguyen the Knicks play defense
	Khoi Anh Nguyen because the Lakers are the Lakers
	Got the DUB my boy JB KILLING THINGS!!
	💯
	Gary Ramsay
	Gosset Keanu
	Corey Robert
	Celtics are the 1 seed but the Knicks are the team nobody wants to play in the playoffs. That defense is crazy.
	Sacramento have form like a yoyo, up down up
	Warriors beat lakers 128-121.
	“Go Knicks‼️”🏀
	I don't remember the last time I saw kings scoring less than 100
	He score Half of Knicks points, selfish player 🤣
	Gin Ichimaru stfu
	Gin Ichimaru who won?
	New York Knicks Vs Sacramento Kings
	Sabonis is not clutch
	Roberto Espinoza y’all take one game and act like it’s a regular thing. Sabonis been killing everybody’s favorite teams
	Roberto Espinoza defensive liability
	Roberto Espinoza ask AD Lakers. 0-10.
	Roberto Espinoza you obviously don't watch kings games!  Sabonis is a beast and been killing it all year!  Knicks are stacked even without Randle!  Sabonis can barely sub out because are 2nd option is most teams third option.  Every game he damn near gets a triple double.  He actively leads the league in double doubles and triple doubles!  Sabonis is top five big man in the league!
	Great game! Players fought their hearts out.  Josh Tiven and the refs were trash!  The three of them need retraining before anymore game assignments!
	42 out of 98 team points is crazyyyyyyyy . respect JB!!!😎😎😎😎😎😎
	Si Davis lng yata kayang kaya nii sabonis. Pati si fox magaling lng pag Lakers kalaban
	Great job
	💯
	Hit me up let’s stack up 💪🏻💰💯
	When they get healthy gonna be a BIG problem in the East
