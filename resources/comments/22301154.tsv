	I hope the nuggets can sustain their great record this coming playoffs! Upon winning a Chip doesn't mean you repeat again! True battle begins in playoffs! Darkhorse teams are more scarier!
	Jokic currently sitting at -10,000 odds for the MVP.
	 really? Have pictures 
	 +2,000 for Luka +3,000 for SGA
	 wow so jokic100%be 23-24 MVP!!?
	 last 10 MVPs have been Vegas favorites
	 So Jokic 100% be MVP 
	 Tody win Minnesota 
	Almost impossible to defeat the Utah Jazz. Nice win!
	oh yea👍👍👍  Good Game.. Nuggets Nation
	Hope to see you and  in the finals
	
	 is the real MVP
	 Not this year my friend maybe 2 to 3 yrs he will be..hehe
	 kung stats pagbasihan layo ra brod.. hahahah sorry but I have to disagree with you this time brod
	 maski wla c luka makaya nla magdaog pag d magplay c jokic mski half game sa regular season bsg d cla kasulod sa playoffs...
	 MVP is para sa overall performance and scoring. the stats says it all. layo ra ang 33.9 PPG vs 26.4 PPG aahahahah
	 ...dili gud...y mn nag MVP c joker 2 consecutive nga permi taas stats n luka kesa sa iya ky ang impact sa game magng team player dili magng stat pad brod...haha....hntod 3rd lng permi vote ky luka sa mvp race ky dili stat ginabasehan
	And Luka with his triple double but not #1 for MVP tho
	 nor should he be
	 what seed is Luka in? 🤔🤔
	 Both were stat padders. Shai is better.
	 look advanced stas,jokic way better
	 yeah he is but it should be better for someone bringing his team out of the play-in, than a team that just won a championship
	 Dalas have seriuos team for this year playoff,belive that can go to wcf
	 oh yes for sure thanks to Gaff and PJ! They finally have a rhythm
	 Dante is great player too
