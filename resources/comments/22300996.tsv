	That clutch 3 by rozier sealed the game
	Here....... LeBron James_ Impact of Experience on Success
	Cavs still missing pieces because of injury. Not sweating the heat.
	Matthew Dennis bam, love, tyler, richardson is out
	Alheízen Acoba   Mitchell, Struss, Mobley and Wade were out.
	Autumn Biggins only mitchell is the all star
	Alheízen Acoba and Duncan
	Alheízen Acoba    So?  They are down 4 of their eight top players.
	Autumn Biggins Cavs being shorthanded is just a sorry excuse for losing. Heat were just as shorthanded with as many important players as Cleveland
	Garrett Rucker clown
	Matthew Dennis and heat not sweating the Cavs or their injuries
	I didn't stutter
	None of those players are better than donovan Mitchell
	Matthew Dennis just like the Heat are missing guys
	JP Ducey again none of them guys are better than Donovan Mitchell.
	Take out Jimmy and you guys get your ass whooped. Take out Mitchell and we lose by 3. Im not sweating the heat.
	Matthew Dennis lol no.
	Sam Redd Mitchell struss mobley wade
	Matthew Dennis lmao you don’t no basketball w just won mad games without butler herro love  bam was carrying the load this team is always doubted the Cavs fucking suck regular season team!
	Bobby Sherman you don't know basketball
	Matthew Dennis half of Heat's roster are out. They will still be very dangerous in the playoffs. I hope they get Cleaveland.
	Matthew Dennis so are the heat. Next man up
	Matthew Dennis damn. Bam played? Herro? D. Robinson?
	Matthew Dennis also heat missing adebayo, herro, robinson and love.
	😂
	😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
	Matthew Dennis So does the Heat. Both teams have their players injured. A win is a win and a lose is a lose. So, man up and support your team on their future games.
	Jet Benito learn to read
	All these clowns replying don't watch or know basketball. 
	Matthew Dennis you could say that about most teams though. Including the heat.
	Miami Heat Vs Cleveland Cavaliers
	Let’s go Heat🔥🔥🔥
	I’m all seriousness we need to lock down!! Mad 3s given
	That shot by Rozier with 3:42 left in the 3rd was clearly a 2 pointer. Yet they called a three. Why didn't they review this? It would have been a tied game with 3 seconds left.🤷🏻 NBA
	Cavs let it slip away down 3 starters
	Let's go heat 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🔥🔥
