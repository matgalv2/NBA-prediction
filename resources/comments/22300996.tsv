	Regardless of the seeding in the playoffs
	That clutch 3 by rozier sealed the game
	Cavs still missing pieces because of injury. Not sweating the heat.

	That shot by Rozier with 3:42 left in the 3rd was clearly a 2 pointer. Yet they called a three. Why didn't they review this? It would have been a tied game with 3 seconds left.🤷🏻
