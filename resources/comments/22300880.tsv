	This game show why we need Westbrook in the game. If Westbrook was in this game clippers win easy. Bench barely scored, Powell only had 6, he would of had more then 6 if Westbrook was in the game to dish him the rock
	Brandon Rankin Giannis didn’t play either
	Mitchell Osness still would of lost if Westbrook played

	😂😂😭
	Mitchell Osness we would of smoked him if he did
	Brandon Rankin lots of ALIBI.
