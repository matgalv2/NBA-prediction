TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
LAL	I don’t care about none of this until I see it in the playoffs against the Nuggets
LAL	Antione Dunlap Mann you ain’t never lied they close games so good we think we got em then BOOM Jamal Murray goes off
LAL	The Lakers dominated and won, while the Warriors lost. What a beautiful day.
LAL	Always hot when it's a lesser team.
LAL	LeBron James had 26 points today he was better than the last game
LAL	He needs to be consistent for the Lakers to have any chance of surviving the play in tournament
LAL	Love to see it, DLo! 🥶
	How about next game? Cold hand?
	Vanstrong Acasio in the last 10 games..he was on fire 9/10
	Vanstrong Acasio stop praying
LAL	Oh yeah! Lakers win again!
LAL	Build around DLow 🙏
LAL	WARRIORS LOST🤣
LAL	Needs to be consistent. Shows up strong for weaker teams, but flat to upper ranking teams. He's the key.
	Armando Fernandez false , 44 against Bucks without Lebron , and many others this year , he only disappears when he doesn’t get his touches , give him the ball , that’s the only thing that needs to be consistent
LAL	Great win today  , I wish they could use that lengthy  guy  at the end of the game,  idk his number  but he has potential for defense  and Mays too  , they could use some minutes .
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Los Angeles Lakers
	He got hot when lakers pulled away already. D
LAL	We needed his hot hand against the Dubs and he never showed up
LAL	How many assists does bron have?? He must be top 5 of assist makers of all time
LAL	Big win for the Lakeshow!
LAL	That Play-In seed is intense! 🤣
LAL	They beat a team with a losing record. They didn't do anything!
LAL	As usual,  dlo always hot when in big and comfortable leading 😁. Lakers needs him when clutch time like vs GS , he disappeared
LAL	Dlo-show
LAL	im excited to see lakers and warriors fighting for  play in.
LAL	Nice Bounce back win Lakers. I hope another win next game
LAL	Dlo hands are cold when facing tough teams, the truth. Can't rely on him but no choice...
LAL	Classic case of this year's Lakers,

LAL	Great game Lakers! 😃
	Every other game or so…
LAL	Keep it up ,let's go lakers 7 or 8
LAL	Congrats D' Angelo Russel for WIN
ATL	"Sure this is the lowly Hawks, but the best thing that might happen to the Lakers is LeBron being only 83 missed shots, or roughly 12 games based on his average number of misses, away from setting the NBA record for missed shots.  LeBron wants so badly to push owning the NBA record for missed shots off until early next year.  That means he either has to shoot less or get ""injured"" for a couple games while they are fighting for Play In position. "
	Raiden Castle Awww...and you tied your shoes all by yourself?!?!?!?!  Maybe one day you'll stop drooling...
LAL	Lakers win
LAL	lakers is back
	Binuhat n nmn ni Dlo 🤣
LAL	So good
LAL	"""Like i never left"""
LAL	Warriors LOSE ,  THEN LAKERS WIN.
LAL	They beat a bad team not impressed
LAL	Against trash teams so DLo not doing 💩
LAL	C🏀NGRATULATIONS  Los Angeles LAKERS 136  WIN over the Hawks 105
LAL	LAKESHOW WIN💜💛
LAL	GOAT PLAYERS are MJ,LBJ,KYRIE IRVING,JAYSON TATUM,LUKA DONCIC, KAWHAI LEONARD,GIANNIS ANTETOKUONPO,AND DONOVAN MICHELLE.👑🏆🏀💪
	And you the most open down player in the NBA.How you made it there
LAL	Lakers lose the 10th seed😭
LAL	He's the best they got
	Clarence Page funny u think this inconsistent player is the best they got
	Kevin Karanza sorry I'm a thunder fan so I don't really give a flying fuck. The other 2 pros can't work together to save their team. Lebron's washed up unless his team bails him out again. So... I'd take this as a win
	😆😭😆😆 you are hilarious!!
LAL	Kevin Karanza ok but he hasn't done shit since he's been there. He's had chances for years and can't get it done. His ego is bigger than the US. Idgaf what he does he will never be the goat and never be Kobe or Michael. He's been average through the ye… Wyświetl więcej
LAL	Kevin Karanza never argue with a LeBron hater.... it's a waste of time and energy bro
	Wow they won?
	THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING OUT THOSE FACING CHALLENGES THIS YEAR, I'II SUPPORT SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH 6
LAL	DLo ❤️❤️❤️
LAL	Sweet revenge
LAL	Lakers are good if the opponent is weak 💯 try to beat Nuggets 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LAL	That amazing 😍
LAL	How possible is that?
LAL	Keep it up
LAL	Go! LAKERS!

ATL	#letsgohawks
LAL	Lebron played every minute too when they were up 20 plus points the whole game. Shows how dedicated this man is and why is he the greatest stat builder of all time.
	Gil Amaquin put ur helmet on LBJ Dk Rider
	Gil Amaquin ogay ucksay Ouray othermay
LAL	Let's be Honest, the Lakers struggle without AD, he's becoming the soul of the team inside the paint right now.
