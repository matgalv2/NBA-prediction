TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I don’t care about none of this until I see it in the playoffs against the Nuggets
	Antione Dunlap Mann you ain’t never lied they close games so good we think we got em then BOOM Jamal Murray goes off
	The Lakers dominated and won, while the Warriors lost. What a beautiful day.
	Always hot when it's a lesser team.
	LeBron James had 26 points today he was better than the last game
	He needs to be consistent for the Lakers to have any chance of surviving the play in tournament
	Love to see it, DLo! 🥶
	How about next game? Cold hand?
	Vanstrong Acasio in the last 10 games..he was on fire 9/10
	Vanstrong Acasio stop praying
	Oh yeah! Lakers win again!
	Build around DLow 🙏
	WARRIORS LOST🤣
	Needs to be consistent. Shows up strong for weaker teams, but flat to upper ranking teams. He's the key.
	Armando Fernandez false , 44 against Bucks without Lebron , and many others this year , he only disappears when he doesn’t get his touches , give him the ball , that’s the only thing that needs to be consistent
	Great win today  , I wish they could use that lengthy  guy  at the end of the game,  idk his number  but he has potential for defense  and Mays too  , they could use some minutes .
	Atlanta Hawks Vs Los Angeles Lakers
	He got hot when lakers pulled away already. D
	We needed his hot hand against the Dubs and he never showed up
	How many assists does bron have?? He must be top 5 of assist makers of all time
	Big win for the Lakeshow!
	That Play-In seed is intense! 🤣
	They beat a team with a losing record. They didn't do anything!
	As usual,  dlo always hot when in big and comfortable leading 😁. Lakers needs him when clutch time like vs GS , he disappeared
	Dlo-show 
	im excited to see lakers and warriors fighting for  play in.
	Nice Bounce back win Lakers. I hope another win next game
	Dlo hands are cold when facing tough teams, the truth. Can't rely on him but no choice...
	Classic case of this year's Lakers,
	Aarangkada na Yan win streak nyo na Yan last 13 games natira 👑💪
	Way to go Lakers 💪💜💛
	Good win for Lakers
	136 - 105 hulks win💪
	Daiki Hand Ball lebrons hater said warriors easy win vs knicks

	Daiki Hand Ball
	He will score 9 the next game
	37 -32 Lebron and AD
	D'lo great 3pts shooters 136-105 lakers.37 -32 w-l.loss atlanta hawk.
	Great game Lakers! 😃
	Every other game or so…
	Keep it up ,let's go lakers 7 or 8
	Congrats D' Angelo Russel for WIN
	"Sure this is the lowly Hawks, but the best thing that might happen to the Lakers is LeBron being only 83 missed shots, or roughly 12 games based on his average number of misses, away from setting the NBA record for missed shots.  LeBron wants so badly to push owning the NBA record for missed shots off until early next year.  That means he either has to shoot less or get ""injured"" for a couple games while they are fighting for Play In position. "
	Raiden Castle Awww...and you tied your shoes all by yourself?!?!?!?!  Maybe one day you'll stop drooling...
	Lakers win 
	lakers is back
	Binuhat n nmn ni Dlo 🤣
	So good
	"""Like i never left"""
	Warriors LOSE ,  THEN LAKERS WIN.  
	They beat a bad team not impressed
	Against trash teams so DLo not doing 💩
	C🏀NGRATULATIONS  Los Angeles LAKERS 136  WIN over the Hawks 105
	LAKESHOW WIN💜💛
	GOAT PLAYERS are MJ,LBJ,KYRIE IRVING,JAYSON TATUM,LUKA DONCIC, KAWHAI LEONARD,GIANNIS ANTETOKUONPO,AND DONOVAN MICHELLE.👑🏆🏀💪
	And you the most open down player in the NBA.How you made it there
	Lakers lose the 10th seed😭
	He's the best they got
	Clarence Page funny u think this inconsistent player is the best they got
	Kevin Karanza sorry I'm a thunder fan so I don't really give a flying fuck. The other 2 pros can't work together to save their team. Lebron's washed up unless his team bails him out again. So... I'd take this as a win
	😆😭😆😆 you are hilarious!!
	Kevin Karanza ok but he hasn't done shit since he's been there. He's had chances for years and can't get it done. His ego is bigger than the US. Idgaf what he does he will never be the goat and never be Kobe or Michael. He's been average through the ye… Wyświetl więcej
	Kevin Karanza never argue with a LeBron hater.... it's a waste of time and energy bro
	Wow they won?
	THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING OUT THOSE FACING CHALLENGES THIS YEAR, I'II SUPPORT SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH 6
	DLo ❤️❤️❤️
	Sweet revenge
	Lakers are good if the opponent is weak 💯 try to beat Nuggets 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	That amazing 😍
	How possible is that?
	Keep it up
	Go! LAKERS!
	Come on Lakers

	Lebron played every minute too when they were up 20 plus points the whole game. Shows how dedicated this man is and why is he the greatest stat builder of all time.
	Gil Amaquin put ur helmet on LBJ Dk Rider

	Let's be Honest, the Lakers struggle without AD, he's becoming the soul of the team inside the paint right now.
