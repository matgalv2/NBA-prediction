	Greatest Cav ever. Honorable mention to the greats Mark Price and Craig Ehlo. No one else worth mentioning. 
	CJ Avery I swear you LeBron haters are a different breed of hater.
	Shan Johnson it's almost like they are trying delusional. I understand not liking someone but the hate they spread on social media is childish and delusional
	Won 14 games out their last 15 games! 2nd in the East! Cavs are ballin! Go Cavs! 🔥🏀🔥🏀🔥
	People are sleeping on the Cavs. They’re a threat.
