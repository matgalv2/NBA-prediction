	Charlotte Hornets Vs Milwaukee Bucks
MIL	And we'll lose the next game cuz we too inconsistent 😂
	Pat Bev and Thannasis will lead this team to many more big victories.
MIL	Lillard should keep it up
MIL	They dogged Carmelo for no D, but won't use the same standards for Dame.
MIL	It’s the hornets. Let’s not act like they beat a competitive team.
	Dwayne Brown I mean, the Hornets have won against the Heat with Jimmy, twice. They’ve beaten the Knicks, top of the league, and the Wolves, also top of the league.
	Alfayeed thank you! People are 
	Alfayeed plus it’s a fun blowout to make them feel confident. Hopefully we can build off this!
	Dwayne Brown boston just beat Washington by a whopping 4 points tho
	Dwayne Brown you need games like that. catch a rhythm.
	Dwayne Brown and if the bucks loose youll going to tell that Its just the Hornest and We loose to a non competitive Team... Didnt you see the Dominance in Score!
	Dwayne Brown true. .
	Dwayne Brown so true! They beat the school of the blind!
	Dwayne Brown But if they lost people would laugh.. Everyone knows they were shorthanded, at least the Bucks showed up and did what a good team should do against a depleted team.
	Dwayne Brown They have struggled against bad teams this season. Detroit was 4-39 at one time and the Bucks had to rally in the fourth quarter to beat the Pistons on three different occasions. They had to rally late to edge the Spurs by four points and the Spurs had like five wins at the time. They beat Washington by like four points, too. So it’s not like they have been dismantling non-competitive teams. It was nice to see a blowout win regardless who it was against.
MIL	First round exit Doc Rivers needs to just disappear from nba world 🤣
	David Adam after multiple 31 comebacks he already should
MIL	You can see that ball rotation is excellent when dame is there...
MIL	The Bucks need go back and get Jr holiday back and Jason Allen come on coach it will never be Bucks again
	Rhonda William jason allen is the GOAT
MIL	I wouldn’t celebrate it’s just hornets 🤣
	And so they should . The question is how can they get passed the teams that are better than 500 and are contenders.

	When Bev drew that play up it was over for the hornets 😂😂
	Did they actually play defense ? I’m assuming it’s just the Hornets
	Cause they been coach by Pat.... 👍
MIL	Bucks' 2nd win under Doc Rivers era.
MIL	A win is a win and I'll take it.
