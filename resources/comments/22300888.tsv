	George Yung Jung man them Pistons been stubborn past couple games they better than the Wizards imo
	George Yung Jung pistons has solid lineup looking forward for next year not my team but future is bright for pistons
	George Yung Jung Pistons have been close with other good teams this year. They gave Boston a run for they’re money. So just because its Detroit don’t mean shit.
