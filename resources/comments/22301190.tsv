TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
NYK	lucky finish. they won't go that far in the playoffs if they struggled with a short handed bulls team 😆
NYK	50 wins this year and playing without their all NBA player in Julius. Incredible. GOOOO KNICKS!!!
NYK	The knicks and the refs strike again they can’t win without the help not surprised. It’s been like that most of the season just like Boston refs refs refs win them games. Overrated just like Boston
NYK	First round exit 4sure
NYK	Miami will sweep you first round
NYK	Great game, Thibs playing DiVincenzo for more than 50 minutes😂
CHI	I think the bulls are really underrated but I'm happy for the knicks. The first round is going to be tough!
	First round exit
NYK	The respect better be as loud as the disrespect has been all year 👂
NYK	Chris Francis it won’t be. But we’re gonna destroy the first round opponent, whether it’s Floppy Embiid, Jimmy Choker, or the soft Pacers
NYK	So proud of these Knicks man. Hope they get Miami. Theyneed that test and payback
NYK	Their Highest Seed on their very last day of the season. The only day that really mattered. “Go ‼️”🏀
NYK	Imagine if he played next to someone like Luka
NYK	Brunson is best thing the Knicks have done in 30 years
CHI	Brando Arrietawill still choke
NYK	All that to get stomped by the Sixers next. Shoulda played Indiana they slumpin
NYK	Only Brunson scoring a 40 ball on the final day of regular season
	The hate in here is so real Lol
NYK	Knicks deserve some respect, Randle has been out for a while. They're going to be tough to beat.
NYK	Let’s go NYKnicks
NYK	Great game at a full house🔥💪♥️
NYK	My favorite player since Villanova.Never missed one of his games.
NYK	What a game that was
	bring on The Heat
NYK	Gettin' it done!
NYK	The Only player in NY🤣
NYK	One of my new favourite players rn
NYK	Look at yall.. nervous that NY making noise..💙🧡💙🧡
NYK	Niles Thomas Nervous ??? They barely beat a 9th seed team missing multiple players. Lol
NYK	Robert Kluver that's how the game goes sometimes... the W is all that matters
	Niles Thomas Nothing to be nervous about.
NYK	most improve player
	Never would’ve expected this Jon Starego
	Adam Christian especially with Randle out
NYK	"""Wow, what a performance by Jalen Brunson! The Knicks are on fire 🔥 Donte DiVincenzo and Nikola Vucevic also had impressive games 💪 #NBAPlayoffs"""
NYK	That’s my New York Knicks go New York go New York go go New York go New York girl💯💯💯🏀
NYK	Mvp mvp!!!
NYK	What a game! There’s no quit in the Knicks, and they’re the 2nd seed in the playoffs. I wanna see them play against the 76ers. Congratulations.
NYK	The knicks missing one good piece to be unstoppable
	Milwaukee loses to play against the 6th Indiana. The 7th Philadelphia, 8th Miami, 9th Chicago, 10th Atlanta. Cleveland against Orlando. Boston and Knicks will face Miami and Philadelphia🥴. Philadelphia is too dangerous right now.
	Who is that lady commentator who said she doesnt think Brunson will lead the knick ms to the playoffs coz HE IS SMALL???
	Dark horse mvp
NYK	Great regular season. Now the season for the chip starts
NYK	Yet they barely beat the bulls 🤦‍♂️
	They are not on the same level as the Celtics
	Radames Pagan were for real. Sucks rsndle is out...brunson is crazy
NYK	good thing they win, but the bad thing is that either philly or heat will swipe them up🤣🤣🤣
NYK	Idc how far the Knicks do or don't make it. This is the point. MVP, and my vote is for him. Without Jalen the Knicks are irrelevant ESPECIALLY considering Julian is out. Dude elevated this team beyond what was expected.
CHI	All that effort to lose to philly
NYK	This man is earning his 💰 💰💰💰💰
NYK	Made me sweat for that one...
	True bawler brunson
NYK	I hope they don’t over work bro
NYK	Is this dude an MVP or what…
CHI	This one hurts 🫠
	Jalen Brunson! Get that man another 10 or 15 mil
NYK	Congratulations
	From a bulls fan this was like a playoff game
	John 14:23
	Chicago Bulls Vs New York Knicks
NYK	They'll be out in first round
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Couldn't have dreamed a better season... now part 2...
NYK	beautiful
NYK	Wow NY is now number 2!?
NYK	🧡😤💙
