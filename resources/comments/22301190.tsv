TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	lucky finish. they won't go that far in the playoffs if they struggled with a short handed bulls team 😆
	50 wins this year and playing without their all NBA player in Julius. Incredible. GOOOO KNICKS!!!
	The knicks and the refs strike again they can’t win without the help not surprised. It’s been like that most of the season just like Boston refs refs refs win them games. Overrated just like Boston
	First round exit 4sure
	Miami will sweep you first round
	Great game, Thibs playing DiVincenzo for more than 50 minutes😂
	I think the bulls are really underrated but I'm happy for the knicks. The first round is going to be tough!
	First round exit
	The respect better be as loud as the disrespect has been all year 👂
	Chris Francis it won’t be. But we’re gonna destroy the first round opponent, whether it’s Floppy Embiid, Jimmy Choker, or the soft Pacers
	So proud of these Knicks man. Hope they get Miami. Theyneed that test and payback
	Their Highest Seed on their very last day of the season. The only day that really mattered. “Go ‼️”🏀
	Imagine if he played next to someone like Luka
	Brunson is best thing the Knicks have done in 30 years
	Brando Arrietawill still choke
	All that to get stomped by the Sixers next. Shoulda played Indiana they slumpin
	Only Brunson scoring a 40 ball on the final day of regular season
	The hate in here is so real Lol
	Knicks deserve some respect, Randle has been out for a while. They're going to be tough to beat.
	Let’s go NYKnicks
	Great game at a full house🔥💪♥️
	My favorite player since Villanova.Never missed one of his games.
	What a game that was
	bring on The Heat
	Gettin' it done!
	The Only player in NY🤣
	One of my new favourite players rn
	Look at yall.. nervous that NY making noise..💙🧡💙🧡
	Niles Thomas Nervous ??? They barely beat a 9th seed team missing multiple players. Lol
	Robert Kluver that's how the game goes sometimes... the W is all that matters
	Niles Thomas Nothing to be nervous about.
	most improve player
	Never would’ve expected this Jon Starego
	Adam Christian especially with Randle out
	"""Wow, what a performance by Jalen Brunson! The Knicks are on fire 🔥 Donte DiVincenzo and Nikola Vucevic also had impressive games 💪 #NBAPlayoffs"""
	That’s my New York Knicks go New York go New York go go New York go New York girl💯💯💯🏀
	Mvp mvp!!!
	What a game! There’s no quit in the Knicks, and they’re the 2nd seed in the playoffs. I wanna see them play against the 76ers. Congratulations.
	The knicks missing one good piece to be unstoppable
	Milwaukee loses to play against the 6th Indiana. The 7th Philadelphia, 8th Miami, 9th Chicago, 10th Atlanta. Cleveland against Orlando. Boston and Knicks will face Miami and Philadelphia🥴. Philadelphia is too dangerous right now.
	Who is that lady commentator who said she doesnt think Brunson will lead the knick ms to the playoffs coz HE IS SMALL???
	Dark horse mvp
	Great regular season. Now the season for the chip starts
	Yet they barely beat the bulls 🤦‍♂️
	They are not on the same level as the Celtics
	Radames Pagan were for real. Sucks rsndle is out...brunson is crazy
	good thing they win, but the bad thing is that either philly or heat will swipe them up🤣🤣🤣
	Idc how far the Knicks do or don't make it. This is the point. MVP, and my vote is for him. Without Jalen the Knicks are irrelevant ESPECIALLY considering Julian is out. Dude elevated this team beyond what was expected.
	All that effort to lose to philly
	This man is earning his 💰 💰💰💰💰
	Made me sweat for that one...
	True bawler brunson
	I hope they don’t over work bro
	Is this dude an MVP or what…
	This one hurts 🫠
	Jalen Brunson! Get that man another 10 or 15 mil
	Congratulations
	From a bulls fan this was like a playoff game
	John 14:23
	Chicago Bulls Vs New York Knicks
	They'll be out in first round
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	Couldn't have dreamed a better season... now part 2...
	beautiful
	Wow NY is now number 2!?
