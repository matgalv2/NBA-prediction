TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
IND	back to back wins for the #pacers!!! siakam proved his worth, as they are now the 6th seed in the east !!! 🙂
	Houston Rockets Vs Indiana Pacers
	Pascal Siakam
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling 
HOU	I still don't understand why the Raptors traded Siakam.... the guy performs week in, week out 🔥
	Edson Kingsley BC he didn't fit their timeline. Better trade him for developmental pieces than remain mediocre or losing him for nothing with his expiring contract
	Edson Kingsley timelines don't match. So we had to.move on but Rap fans wish Pascal and Pacers success.
	Edson Kingsley the Raps develop many players and trade them --- it seems they are in the money making business --- everyone knows they need a couple of 7 footers like Gashol and Ibaca to clog up the middle etc --  Raps have many ex Raps starring on other teams
	Pace - Pace - Pacers with the W!
