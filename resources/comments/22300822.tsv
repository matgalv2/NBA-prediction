TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	this kid is amazing i just love his game and personality
	Gregory Raspberry Moi aussi
	MVP
	The problem is, can they replicate the performances when the playoffs get underway.
	Some of y'all hating but okc got one of the best records in the league right now
	Alexander Miller MVP!!!
	Alexander Miller wolves are better*^
	Alexander Miller f u and OKC. 🤡
	Ant Man 😭😂👍
	He is the mvp for sure .. the other guy from Denver try exactly to do either purpose triple doubles to make himself interesting otherwise he will not be in the mvp conversation
	George Tolik joker doesn’t even have to try to get triple doubles. Comes naturally to him. And he has proven that over and over again
	Ashton Taylor no way .. I know that he does with purpose to win the mvp.. but mvp in the 80 s 90 and I think in the year 2015 you must be exceptional to win a mvp award in the regular season . In the last 8 years is very easy to win mvp … to say you are mvp you must win championship and finals mvp … mvp in the regular season with no defence in the last 10 years is a joke
	George Tolik umm. He did win championship and finals MVP. Where have you been. He literally doesn’t care about basketball enough to even try every night. You’re a hater, plain and simple, because your team is garbage.
	George Tolik and the fact you isolated the year 2015, shows you’re a curry fanboy. Nothing else.
	Ashton Taylor I don’t think that international players are good for the nba and I am a European too
	George Tolik you not even watch nuggets,bozo
	I am not a fanboy mr I see basketball in the last 35 years and right now nba is a premadonna circus
	George Tolik then why bring up 2015?
	Here’s another player the NBA took from Charlotte.
	Parker Whittaker thankfully
	Parker Whittaker Dear Don't Skip,
	No one can guard this man
	Well done, SGA!!
	Shai gilgeous Alexander 2 mejor anotador de NBA está temporada y segundo entre point guard armador base con 31.2 por partido altísimo líder también robos por partido
	Imagine KD reuniting with his former team OKC.
	MVP!!!
	Needed  shai to get 6 assists and OKC to win by 11 points plus.. was a close last 2 minutes with shai getting 2 assists and luckily they ran the clock out with 37 seconds to go
	40 wins before 20 losses….Thunder Up!
	He might win MVP
	Shai ❤️
	OKC 2024 FINALS CHAMPION
