TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Good ‘bounce back’ after yesterday 🤩
	They gonna pass the wizards in wins
	Ken King as we should we been cheated out of so many games this year i lost count not to mention all the games we could’ve won but lost in the last few possessions we been fighting all year
	Ken King Pistons  play better than  wizards
	NBA- with your agreement to 2k you are allowing them to,
	They should have 10 wins already, got robbed yesterday
	Conrad Chin
	Conrad Chin hush  up hater.
	Conrad Chin bet that loss gon motivate to win more
	I wonder what ownership would do if nobody shows up for the games anymore
	Detroit to playoffs semi finals
	Very good from this lads .....They are good but just so unlucky
	9 win 40 loses 🤪
	Rusty Noem CabLo Adang should be 10 win 😆 Lol
	Rusty Noem CabLo Adang  looks like they have won  18%
	Rusty Noem CabLo Adang 9-49
	Chicago needs to tear down that roster and start the rebuild process
	True underdog STORY. I say next season pistons FINALS  champ with the draft pick
	9th win for Detroit Pistons of the 2023-24 NBA Season
	Maybe they’ll get double digits this season
	Cade and Victor W. would be a great duo
	Maybe by Season end you all can pick up Win # 10!
	Rob at the MSG last game 😔
	So close to the play in...
	at last, they won 😂😂😂😂😂😂
	Holy hell, they might hit the milestone of 10 wins next game
	Do the parade now lol😆
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović pobjeda Pistonsa na terenu na kojem baš vole pobijedit..
	Christina Chen有夠可憐我們沒去看就輸球
	Dami nnmn iiyak ahhaha
	OG Sancho worry about bulls not baseball 😂
	Ethan Agustin-Co should’ve been 2 in a row
	Panalo sana sila kahapon eh
	Sabate KyleGabriel
	Detroit in game 6
	Taylor Bucknell
	Michael Gutierrez 😳
	Seth Goss it’s good to have you getting froggy again my guy. I don’t like when you hide 😂
	Michael Gutierrez don’t use froggy with me. Ever.
	David Sandlers 🤣
	That’s cade and em
	Reason why Detroit fans are so mad about being robbed of an ultimately pointless win is because it ultimately isn’t pointless. Seeing the young talent find a chemistry that works is important leading into the future. When you have nothing to show for your efforts but a lottery pick, it’s hard to build any sort of culture.
	Come on bulls this is complete garbage
	Lmao Bulls lost at home to the worst team in the NBA, while the Pistons were on the end of a back-to-back. Bulls are super trash.
	CADE CUNNINGHAM debería de ir a otro equipo el es el único q carga al equipo de Detroit Pistons
	Should be 2 game win streak
	Eric J Perkins maybe 3 because of game winning shot by Banchero
	Pistons are tied with wizards record, they are no longer the worst team in the nba
	They are building towards a good future. It takes time.
	congrats..finally you get the Win..9-49..
	Congratulations💯💯💯
	Should be THREE WINS in a row. Got hosed on the uncalled travel vs the Magic on Banchero. And the obvious AF clusterfu*k against the Knicks!
	finally
	王慶豐”the perfect”
	Henry go ahead and hit reset on the whole damn season.
	Madison Lucashow smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ glad I ain’t watch it

	Bulls organization sucks
	The pistons must of been warned about tanking because all of a sudden they are an NBA caliber team
	Ryan Hillier Its amazing what spacing can do for a roster that desperately needed it
	Rossco Singaa the team has some good players in each position and a coach with a pretty good track record. They never should've lost that many games in a row in the first place imo
	Ryan Hillier they're just got robbed yesterday and the other day
	Rhon Cadavas they've been winning games before tonight fam
	Fuck Jerry Reinsdorf Bulls are the worst team in the NBA with the worst owner...ask Jerry Reinsdorf why he doesn't care about winning
	Should be a three game win streak

	As a bulls fan that’s embarrassing
	They should have 10 wins already, got robbed yesterday

	Embarrassing loss for the Bulls
	Okay the bulls should be ashamed i'm done
	Why do the bulls suck? They have so much talent, it’s frustrating
	2nd win vs the shit bulls this season. They’d be a playoff team if they just played the god awful bulls
