	Michael Gutierrez don’t use froggy with me. Ever.
	David Sandlers 🤣
DET	That’s cade and em
DET	Reason why Detroit fans are so mad about being robbed of an ultimately pointless win is because it ultimately isn’t pointless. Seeing the young talent find a chemistry that works is important leading into the future. When you have nothing to show for your efforts but a lottery pick, it’s hard to build any sort of culture.
CHI	Come on bulls this is complete garbage
CHI	Lmao Bulls lost at home to the worst team in the NBA, while the Pistons were on the end of a back-to-back. Bulls are super trash.
	CADE CUNNINGHAM debería de ir a otro equipo el es el único q carga al equipo de Detroit Pistons
DET	Should be 2 game win streak
DET	Eric J Perkins maybe 3 because of game winning shot by Banchero
DET	Pistons are tied with wizards record, they are no longer the worst team in the nba
