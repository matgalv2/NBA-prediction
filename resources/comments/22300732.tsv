	Goatman23 mas mukha ka pa ngang iyakin ehh gumawa pa tlga ng page para ihate si lebron 🤣
	Goatman23 another dumb guy with a small brain, I pity you😂😂😂😂😭🤣
	Goatman23 What the hell you talking about? Lebron is a b-ball god, he can beat him even now at age 39. ahahahah do you even watch ball? Ivey can be compared to someone like Khris Middleton, do not ever even compare him to Jaden Ivey. Ivey is nothing compare to L.James nothinggg King James yoooooo.!!!!!!

	Goatman23 obsessed 😆😆
	Goatman23 this comment is screaming hey look at me i need some attention🤦🏾
	You have to watch these teams in the bottom I think they are more hungrier to win. They can do a lot of damage to teams that are trying to get to the playoffs! My Cavs had a hard time with the Wizards last night which are right above the Pistons, but they pulled it off and they also had a good game against the  Pistons! But they didn’t have that much trouble beating the Kings and Clippers in the last 10 days. So never say never!
	Ivey and Duren, a big part of team going forward.  Play them, let them develop their skills and experience.  Promising future for both of them!
	Dennis Boren Hello, your Facebook always shows up in my recommended friends list and you really impress me. I don't usually write in the comments section, but I think Facebook suggested that we become friends and if you are also interested in me, you can send me a friend request.
	Everybody been getting their career high against the Kings!
	And this is why the Kings will never win 🏆
	Thats why fox deserve an allstar 
	Aicho Duarte hehehe no wonder the get the SNUBBED 🙃🙃🙃
	Aicho Duarte
	Jaden Ivey said enough is enough I’m tired of losing 😭😭
	holaaa, holla....
	Ivey is better than Jordan Poole 😁
	I wonder who the pistons will beat next haha, always fun to watch their games
	Conrad Chin they don't win often lol
	Nick Wilbur that’s why, even though they only have 7 wins, they stunned OKC and kings
	will sit next two games
	Ivey literally carried the load 
	The Detroit will go to the playoffs
	Ivey is more impactful than Cade
	Go Ivey😍
	Grabe swerte Ng piston tang inis
	I'm still shocked how the light the beam Kings lost to the worst team in the NBA.
	Ric Forya These teams at the bottom are hungrier to win! I honestly think the good teams slack when they play the teams that only have won a few games. Never say never!
	Ric Forya pistons just beat the thunder bro… its the nba
	Teams playing their first game after a long road trip always struggle first game back. Happened with the clips as well
	Kid was a beast  at Purdue, turn him loose Detroit Pistons!!!!

	Mads Lund Šakota-Olsen 👀

	Good Road Win By The Pistons
	This season:
	Jaden is better than self-proclaimed greatest shooter lol
	Kenneth Solomon Jaden 37 points &gt; Curry 9 points &gt; LeBron 0 points what a day 🔥
	Oh, oh, the  Blazers need to take heed for tomorrow nite!!!!
	Finally! Here they come 🔥
	7-43 is horrendous. 🤣
	The kings were classless for showing that lions-niners clip at the beginning and they got served. Karma has its way
	Gab Kulass not all sacramento kings fans support the niners!
	To piston 7. 🏆 43.loads of funny 😄
	Igual no llegan a playoffs ni al play in esos pistons 😆😆
	7 games....🤣🤣🤣
	Nba is weird these days anyone can lose to anyone lmao

	أللهم صل على سيدنا محمد
	About 50 games late but not bad
	C'est bizzare le basketball
	A for sure needed win .. good job guys !
	Trade Curry to the Pistons. That's the only way the warriors can go back to their best performance.
	James Cruz 🫵🧠🤏
	Dudes way better than cade tbh
	may chance pa manalo piston, pag wala si cunningham hahaha
	Cade masmagaling sakanya ang 6 sakanila ngaun Lang nakaraang January nakapaglaro sa piston ive burks durin muscala sasser Thompson at isa pa
	Elena Savino mahusay naman si cunningham maglaro kung tutuosin, pero may nabago kasi sa laruan ng piston di sya makapag adjust ng laro hirap sya sa rotation pag hawak nya na yung bola hawak nya na talaga nasisira yung gameplan hahaha
