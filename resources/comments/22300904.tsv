	Only Jokic is as good as Luka overall 👏.
	 Antman is better overall
	This dude does this every night against anyone...LOL
	Win streak is on the way!
	Luka Doncic
	Another season without any success for the Mavericks. Most probably, they will go home after the first round of playoffs
	 go suck one
	El 5 triple doble consecutivos de doncic y 2 de eso juegos consecutivos Dallas a ganao uno primero Toronto raptors y ahora a el Miami Heat equipo de diferente conferencias los Dallas Mavericks con equipos de diferentes conferencia tiene récord 14-10 con un muy buen porcentaje de 120.5 Dallas está entre lo 6 mejores anotadores en contra de la conferencia este    y doncic que tiene casi triple doble en su número 34.6 y 9.0 en Rebote y 9.8 en asistencia el mejor anotador entre los point guard es este tipo doncic y tiro en este juego de 12-24 de 50% porciento este forward-guard de los Dallas Mavericks titular Luka doncic y todos los triples doble son 30 o más puntos de este tipo una verdadera máquina ese muchacho y el triple doble número 43 de doncic con 30 o más puntos en un partido este muchacho es un forward-guard que callao puede anotar mucho puntos de por vida
	Luka super ball hugger just like lebron.. he wl get a good stats but never be a champion w his game as one man ball taker ..
	 so you compare him to LEBRON then say he will never get a chip when LEBRON has 4
	 Bro have you watched the game？
	 Hater
	 crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	
	 Men, he's one of the bes assisters in the league...
	 well yeah when your team is struggling you want your best playmaker and best shooter to have the ball....
	 how he get 11 assist if he ball hogging ? 😂😂
	 he had 11 ast lmao stfu
	 Luka the ball hugging ball taker
	 lebron got 4 rings goofy
	Luka was the difference
	Luka doing everything in his power to keep us in a game night after night. Jason Kidd is a joke and we don’t play defense. I’m a Mavs fan and can’t wait for Luka to bounce so I can ditch this franchise
	 you ain’t a Mavs fan
	MVP, MVP, MVP!!!!

	 24*
	The goat 🐐
	Miami Heat Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Antonis Papadimitriou pretty sure they were in conference finals a couple years ago. If you define success as a champion....well only 1 successful team a season.
	Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
	Probably this guy would be the future GOAT of NBA. The NBA is now ruled by foreign players, mostly the Europeans. If this trend continues, in the coming years the Starters in each team might be foreigners and the reserves are Americans 😁 Meantime, <a tabindex=😄😅😂🤣
	"""I'm thrilled to announce that I've won the lottery, and I want to use this opportunity to help those in need. I'm looking for ways to make a positive impact actually made a promise to God to help the needy no matter what"
	better than lequeen leflop.
	 There's a link on my bio tap to get in
	Luka Doncic had 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to become the second NBA player to record five consecutive 30-point triple-doubles, and the Dallas Mavericks rallied past the Miami Heat 114-108 on Thursday night.
	yo! omg 2 more children🔥😂
	Respect!…,
	Scores big a lot but where his team mates to improve that record seems like another bron!
	 you can find  it in his assist departmént🤣
	 11 assist really? A team to get into at least 15th spot consistent 23.0 assist…. Just saying
	 in the assist area of team sport.
	 average 2 digit assist is not enough for you?
	 bro statistically a team averages that… and you put that as a record with the wins you got? Doesn’t make sense…. I love bron but team wise is selfish
	" exactly, people do not understand. Bron is a good passer, but that shit has no impact on winning if he decides to be the one who control possessions 48% of the time. Dude needs to play off the ball more. They know how to stop him.

	 bron brought his team 10 times in the finals and won 4 titles. How he become selfish?
