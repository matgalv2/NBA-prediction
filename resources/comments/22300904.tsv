	Luka Doncic
	Another season without any success for the Mavericks. Most probably, they will go home after the first round of playoffs
	Antonis Papadimitriou go suck one
	Reyes Gonzalez you have real problems with your temper.
	Luka super ball hugger just like lebron.. he wl get a good stats but never be a champion w his game as one man ball taker ..
	Hossam Hisham so you compare him to LEBRON then say he will never get a chip when LEBRON has 4
	Hossam Hisham Bro have you watched the game？
	Hossam Hisham Hater

	Luka was the difference
	Best player in the world
	Luka doing everything in his power to keep us in a game night after night. Jason Kidd is a joke and we don’t play defense. I’m a Mavs fan and can’t wait for Luka to bounce so I can ditch this franchise
	Dylan Ondarza you ain’t a Mavs fan
	And not even on the MVP list lol
	Ha Yura Of course Mavs are 8th Seed lol

	The goat 🐐
	Gary Shackelford I think you have the wrong person...
	😊
	Gary Shackelford Goats are always good and the goat is a durian entrepreneur
	Miami Heat Vs Dallas Mavericks
	Antonis Papadimitriou pretty sure they were in conference finals a couple years ago. If you define success as a champion....well only 1 successful team a season.
	Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
	"""I'm thrilled to announce that I've won the lottery, and I want to use this opportunity to help those in need. I'm looking for ways to make a positive impact actually made a promise to God to help the needy no matter what"
	Probably this guy would be the future GOAT of NBA. The NBA is now ruled by foreign players, mostly the Europeans. If this trend continues, in the coming years the Starters in each team might be foreigners and the reserves are Americans 😁 Meantime, while LBJ (the King of Kings) is still actively playing let's enjoy his greatness. This might be the last time we witness the dominance of an American player in the NBA. Foreigners, mostly Europeans are slowly taking over the league. Long live the King of Kings, long live the Greatest of all Greats, long live LeBron James, the Chosen One 😁😄😅😂🤣
	Luka Doncic had 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to become the second NBA player to record five consecutive 30-point triple-doubles, and the Dallas Mavericks rallied past the Miami Heat 114-108 on Thursday night.
	better than lequeen leflop.
	Louie Atlantis There's a link on my bio tap to get in
	Scores big a lot but where his team mates to improve that record seems like another bron!
