DAL	Antonis Papadimitriou pretty sure they were in conference finals a couple years ago. If you define success as a champion....well only 1 successful team a season.
DAL	Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
SPAM	"""I'm thrilled to announce that I've won the lottery, and I want to use this opportunity to help those in need. I'm looking for ways to make a positive impact actually made a promise to God to help the needy no matter what"
DAL	Probably this guy would be the future GOAT of NBA. The NBA is now ruled by foreign players, mostly the Europeans. If this trend continues, in the coming years the Starters in each team might be foreigners and the reserves are Americans 😁 Meantime, while LBJ (the King of Kings) is still actively playing let's enjoy his greatness. This might be the last time we witness the dominance of an American player in the NBA. Foreigners, mostly Europeans are slowly taking over the league. Long live the King of Kings, long live the Greatest of all Greats, long live LeBron James, the Chosen One 😁😄😅😂🤣
DAL	Luka Doncic had 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to become the second NBA player to record five consecutive 30-point triple-doubles, and the Dallas Mavericks rallied past the Miami Heat 114-108 on Thursday night.
