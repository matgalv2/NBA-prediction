	Siakam &gt;  by a mile!
	I feel he is the only player that is consistent.
	He is our best all around player.  Hope they can resign him in the offseason
	Pascal 's impact is felt in the Pacers. The guy keeps on improving his game. One of my favourite players in the NBA
	Now he is a real deal to help the Pacers build for the Chip.
