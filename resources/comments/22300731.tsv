TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	4th straight wins for the #pelicans!!! they snapped the  4th game winning streak of the #clippers!!! congrats 🙂
	Pinoy Ako lol thinking that pelicans will amaze you like miami lol 1st round exit for pelicans
	"""Win or lose"" i still believe in the system of #clippers 😎👌 hmm🤔 the Regular Season is not ended yet.  So many days and weeks to go and the western standings still getting close😎👍  "
	&amp; just like that, the clippers back to 4th place 😂😂😂
	Albert Grant its going to be a Wild wild west as always..
	Albert Grant and with one win again on the #1..
	Preview of what would happen in Clippers come playoffs. From seeded 1st down to 4th in less than 24 hrs, pfft.
	Mel Yonaryo you must be a lakers fan. They won’t even see neither one of those seeds
	Mel Yonaryo so one game ok
	Mel Yonaryo They also went no.1 seed suddenly, so it's not a big deal.
	Mel Yonaryo they're 0.5 games back chill 🤣

	Mel Yonaryo i don'T think so..
	Let's see if these Pelicans beat the Lakers on their next game!! It's gonna be crazy and an indication that they took the win on the Clips personally lol if they lose to Lakers
	Ethan Astrologo Clips are all exhausted due to their straight wins this week.
	Ethan Astrologo
	Ethan Astrologo LeChampion beat them

	Here we go .. all those haters quiet for 2 months now sounding off on 1 loss on a bad night for everyone on the clippers 😂 .. must have been terrible having nothing to say for that long 😂
	Robert Barrios  it’s the media though they looooved that initial 5 game losing streak with harden
	Robert Barrios relax dude. Your clippers ain't gonna reach the Finals anyways.
	Robert Barrios You're right. They have been waiting for this moment since December 🤣🤣🤣
	Robert Barrios its preview play off no one see LAC as a threat or take them serious , they can be #1 seed until play offs and still wouldn’t win a chip
	Robert Barrios Hello baby how are you doing today ? I’m available for fun , incall and outcall available  and would you like to meet ?
	Robert, they needed that loss. it doesn’t hurt them that much, and is still in a virtual tie with the teams ahead of them.
	Here is a legit source for fixed bets 
	Nice W for the Pelicans, America wins when Clippers lose
	Marquis Swinton sound just like a hater 😂😂😂
	Which America 🤣😂
	South America, lol
	1 day trial for the no. 1 seed clippers.!😆
	PG gotta do better. I understand we coming off a 7 game road trip though and that can be tiring but still gotta do better
	Brandon Rankin yeah he stunk up the arena last night!
	So many stars but not even one from clippers can guard zion…
	Fox Low but when Zion doesn't play, do you cry or laugh at him nor his team lol you must be proud that Pels take a breather and had healthy zion deep in the reg season
	Ethan Astrologo when he did not play just pray for him
	Fox Low it's the same as Kawhi were just glad both of them are playing and giving us best performances just to entertain people so don't take the clippers' efforts into nothing they'll just bounce back easily and re-gather some more wins
	He lead the way in points but it was Zion that took control in the 2nd half. CJ got hot in the 4th.
	Joe Adams man, CJ made them timely clutch buckets.
	Phillip Laroche no doubt

	Clippers clipped my ticket tonight 😪 ..
	Nice game pilicans
	ZW1, fueron 10 asistencias y no 10 rebotes

	Nagkaroon rin ng katapat ang clippers d man lang maka lamang 4 super star vs wala
	What a win by
	tumae lng clippers sa #1seed balik ulit purok 4
	Yaaaay, WTG! Geaux New Orleans Pelicans 🏀

	New Orleans Pelicans Vs Los Angeles Clippers
	And just like that, the Clippers short lived the #1 spot in the West and drop to 4th lol
	Hector Lopez clippers n lafakers sux
	SonGlad my Pelicans beat the Flippers..😁💪🏾
	Joe Bullock 💪🏾 pelican in playoff
	All along i thought Lillard was the man. Now this is the man. Lillard and westbrook had best players playing with them thats Durant and CJ when the bestt players leave then the team crumbles to pieces, now we can see that westbrook and Lillard can't ball
	Ante Boban boljka Clippersa se ponavlja - svako s jakom 4-kom ih dobije. Evo i Zion ih terorisao i u odbrani i u napadu.
	Nice game 
	Yea iknew we were going to end up in 4th place idk why mfs was hyped to be first for one day when u got mfs like pandemic P dropping 7 points
	Zion was just abusing plumlee in the paint smh
	Jayvion Seright Bagley how many layups can zion choke on
	McCollum should link back up with DAME TIME in Milwaukee and make a few runs at that ring gang
	Daming talo sa clippers 😅
	Let's see!
	Idk what’s more depressing, being a clipper fan or actually believing they’re winning a title 🤣
	Jonathan Russian clippers 10straight wins,and just 2-3  loses makes you think they are not winning a title in westcon?lol
	&amp; based on that, they’re winning a title 🤣
