TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	De Mar DeRozen you are great!!!
	Good win
	This team from Illinois is very unpredictable...
	DeMar has to be a Hall of Famer
	 he should be he’s definitely better than some of the legends of “yesterday” same with Paul George
	Greatest bulls player ever!
	Chicago Bulls Vs Indiana Pacers
	Il a tué mes 118k sur Betclic ahhhh 💔pourtant vers la fin on menait 🥲
	Yes bulls won bet that let's go
	Demar needs to go to a contender maybe during summer join them boys in the mile high
	At what age will Durant retire?
	 as soon as he gets a ring without steph
	DeMar could be my fav player aside from kd and giannis but damn he needs to improve his defense.
	De Mar 
	Great win
	so cool win
	With ² 2 points that's wow
	👏🏾💪🏾
	🙌🏽
	Nice 👍🏼
	Indiana Pacers play defense worse than the Los Angeles Lakers!
	I've been watching the bulls since 84 and have been a fan of Jordan since then. But I think, it's safe to say that Demar Derozan, is at least 3 times better than prime Michael Jordan. All facts ✅💯 
	Now they will lose by 30 points in the next game
	Demar Derozan. Such a hooper.
	Get it Demar!!!
	Yeah good
	DeMar DeRozan
	And then here comes playoffs time. 😂 Demar is like the Avatar of his team everytime playoffs come.. when his team needed him the most, he vanished. 😂
	He is the man!!!
	How can you get rid of this guy when he constantly performs like a star?
	Deebo is HIM
	Congratulations💯💯💯
	
	DeMar DeRozan hit 46
	🐐
	Congrats!
	 smiles of a winner
