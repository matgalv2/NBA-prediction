TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	De Mar DeRozen you are great!!!
	Good win
	This team from Illinois is very unpredictable...
	DeMar has to be a Hall of Famer
	Paul Whitinui he should be he’s definitely better than some of the legends of “yesterday” same with Paul George
	Yes bulls won bet that let's go
	Chicago Bulls Vs Indiana Pacers
	Greatest bulls player ever!
	"De Mar ""De caliber "" DeRozan.....Triple De💪"
	Demar needs to go to a contender maybe during summer join them boys in the mile high
	Il a tué mes 118k sur Betclic ahhhh 💔pourtant vers la fin on menait 🥲
	so cool win
	At what age will Durant retire?
	Sarah Cooper as soon as he gets a ring without steph
	DeMar could be my fav player aside from kd and giannis but damn he needs to improve his defense.
	Great win
	With ² 2 points that's wow
	👏🏾💪🏾
	🙌🏽
	Nice 👍🏼
	Indiana Pacers play defense worse than the Los Angeles Lakers!
	I've been watching the bulls since 84 and have been a fan of Jordan since then. But I think, it's safe to say that Demar Derozan, is at least 3 times better than prime Michael Jordan. All facts ✅💯 #BullsGoat
	Now they will lose by 30 points in the next game
	Demar Derozan. Such a hooper.
	Get it Demar!!!
	Yeah good
	And then here comes playoffs time. 😂 Demar is like the Avatar of his team everytime playoffs come.. when his team needed him the most, he vanished. 😂
	DeMar DeRozan
	He is the man!!!
	How can you get rid of this guy when he constantly performs like a star?
	Congratulations💯💯💯
	Deebo is HIM
	Leonardo Class
	DeMar DeRozan hit 46
