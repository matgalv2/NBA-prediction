IND	Indiana Pacers play defense worse than the Los Angeles Lakers!
CHI	I've been watching the bulls since 84 and have been a fan of Jordan since then. But I think, it's safe to say that Demar Derozan, is at least 3 times better than prime Michael Jordan. All facts ✅💯 #BullsGoat
IND	Now they will lose by 30 points in the next game
CHI	Demar Derozan. Such a hooper.
