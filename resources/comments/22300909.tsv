NOP	I watched the Pelicans a few times before the New Year. Zion destroyed Anthony Davis and the Lakers. I also watched Zion go to work on the Joker and Denver. He had 23 at the half. The Pelicans have just been battling and jelling since then and when they have all their pieces on the floor they are a force to reckon with in the league. Go Pelicans!!!

NOP	I’m sorry! I’m starting to get to a point that I’m not going to watch this team anymore! They never really in games anymore. When I checked the score tonight it was 55-20 &amp; another time 92-72 with the 3rd quarter almost over. It tells me even though it sounded somewhat close the   Pelicans were probably taking their starters out because the   Sixers sucked so bad tonight. I never thought I would say this in a million years but I’m better off watching a   Flyers game. At least I know there’s a chance they are going to win.
NOP	Zion Williamson
NOP	Pels playing good ball but Philly in trouble
NOP	Pelicans are being soo scary
