	New Orleans Pelicans Vs Philadelphia 76ers
	Big players 💪💪💪
	I watched the Pelicans a few times before the New Year. Zion destroyed Anthony Davis and the Lakers. I also watched Zion go to work on the Joker and Denver. He had 23 at the half. The Pelicans have just been battling and jelling since then and when they have all their pieces on the floor they are a force to reckon with in the league. Go Pelicans!!!
	Let you play, do all your talk.Sounds the critics or the haters however they come
	He is actually playing really good this year
	Embiid the most overrated MVP SMFH

	I’m sorry! I’m starting to get to a point that I’m not going to watch this team anymore! They never really in games anymore. When I checked the score tonight it was 55-20 &amp; another time 92-72 with the 3rd quarter almost over. It tells me even though it sounded somewhat close the   Pelicans were probably taking their starters out because the   Sixers sucked so bad tonight. I never thought I would say this in a million years but I’m better off watching a   Flyers game. At least I know there’s a chance they are going to win.
	Zion Williamson
	Pels playing good ball but Philly in trouble
	Pelicans are being soo scary
	Pelicans been real pissed since the Allstar break, disrespecting Herb on defense is just crazy. Watch out !!!
