TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	I’m impressed he dropped over 18
	I’m surprised none of his stats were… in the teens
	Josh Diddy is a really good player.
	Gerald Lewis man can't even look at another pic of a man without thinking about diddy u sir are sus
	Gerald Lewis Paul M Davis Jr.💀💀 Josh Diddy is a wiiiiild one
	☠️
	Josh Diddy is CRAZY 😭
	Josh Giddey was heating up on this one
	Giddy has been great recently. Love to see it!
	Nick Jordan putting up teen numbers
	Spurs championship prediction year 2060
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	Jonel Campuso bron don’t like teens either
	Lebrons the goat
	That is just a MINOR contribution on the team win.
	Hit up a nearby Chuck E. Cheese afterward to celebrate lol
	Giddy gives 20 and 12 new meaning
	Pick someone from the stands they would land a triple on the spurs
	He had more points than his girls age.
	Austin Noble And more points than your IQ.
	Adrian Surrentino good one goofy
	He cheesing like he at a high school pep rally.... oh wait 🤣🤣
	I’m here for the comments 🍿
	He looks so happy, such an innocent child
	Oh he went off against the spurs bench 😂
	Drake Hutton fr, pretty much bench from start to finish lol
	Josh kiddey **
	April Ja Giddey's kiddies
	A few more minutes and he would have triple double!🏀
	Has played better as of late.
	not really an acheivement, one is looking forward to next year and cares little about this year. The other is already in the playoffs pretty much, so a pointless game with no real purpose.
	"Yes Josh"" heavy work in the key/points to go with the points,Hayward best return since arrival and failure to dominate without opposition Rookie sensation. Will be alright come playoff time."
	When is his court case??
	So proud of the Thunder!
	Bruh must have been so mad he scored over 18
	I mean he scored a double digit this time. Can’t say the same about his dating life
	I know he scored at least a 14
	He looks happy.
	courtside lil kids
	Another awful season for the Spurs. 22 wins last season,Wemby not a difference maker.
	Wow. He got under 18 assists and under 18 rebounds.
	Raymond Lorica everything he does is... under 18
	Those stats are Minor
	Somewhere Steven A Smith and Kwame Brown is punching the air
	The face you make when you mock your siblings
	I came here for the comments....ya'll did not disappoint me
	Timothy Bunch
	I still can’t believe he gotta away with his BS
	Man they let this dude just slip away wit them allegations swept it rite under the rug
	He likes his women like he likes his assist numbers.
	Don’t let him get near kids after this game!!!! No fan meetups. What so ever.
	Can’t think of a minor joke
	Don’t matter. Wolves in 4
	He actually looks giddy in this pic.
	Gotta get some girls 😆 🤣
	I'm so irritated in his face
	A minor double double
	He know shorty bout to be over age so he ballin
	Giddy forgot to put his bottom teeth in.
	Where is the feeling alien...
	Giddey age 20
	Let's go Wemby
	It’s wild FB tells us which comments are “most relevant”. How did we get here?
	I guess rapini can give u strength
	Looking like the girl from Taken
	God bless you Josh!
	OKC really2 wants to face the lakers in the 1st round I like that keep going 😅
	Jøe Mar if bron plays okc wins in 5, Bron is the biggest cancer possible for that lakers team rn.
	Alex Duggan are you on drugs rn?
	San Antonio Spurs Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
	Finally over 18 legal in many states 😃
	20-12+7 💀
	Robert King
	Quintin Watts
	Giddy the diddy
	Musta been some 12 year olds Courtside
	His favorite stat was his rebounding
	20 seem a bit too legal
	Dont give em too much praise he might go pedophile huntin for another teenager... sure the league wont investigate, they only hold the black players accountable0
	Wemby better than the whole thunder organization
