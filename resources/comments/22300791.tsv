	Chris finch should be the coach of the year
	Arlen Hartoonian hi
MIN	Arlen Hartoonian he's coaching the West all star team.
	Arlen Hartoonian wanna see 
MIN	Anthony Edwards will win MVP.
	Serkan Karatepe he's good but I doubt that
	Alice Dorsch in 2010/11 season, Derrick Rose won the MVP due to him carrying his team to the top spot while Miami created their big 3. 2005/06 season,Steve Nash won his MVP due to him carrying his team to the top spot. Therefore it is possible.
	Serkan Karatepe hmm🤔🤔 that's actually a fair point🙂🙂 well, let's see how it goes. 
	Alice Dorsch why and he leading his team to best record of the conference? Let me guess stats matter more than winning to you.
	Terrence McHatten he's a good player no doubt,
	Alice Dorsch wanna get raped?
MIN	Very happy for my hometown team , but will remain a little cynical for the time being.
	Sean Latimer……
	Imagine if he got the same calls as sga did he'd average 40 👀
	Dimitris Papageorgiou exactly but nah people wanna say SGA is better 🤦‍♂️

	Let’s call these games off  when the dominant team leads by 35 after 3rd quarter; it’s over, besides: only the referees are watching those games!
	If the refs give him any foul calls. He'll easily have 10 more points every night. It's sad how they don't blow the whistle for Ant. The defender that stepped into his landing space when he shot the 3 could have ended badly. And they didn't give him th… Wyświetl więcej
