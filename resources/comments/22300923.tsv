POR	NBA better watch out, the Domin-Ayton's domination about to start!!
POR	😂
POR	His inconsistency has half of the fan base  totally out on him, but if he could get even 20% more consistent with performance and availability, he could be a fringe all-star player.
POR	For the casuals, he's been balling out the last 10-15 games in a row. In no way am I excusing his apprent lack of motor, but he's definitely starting to find a fit.
POR	Better than Softic from the Suns
POR	Todd A. Norin -Really? Softic grabbed 31 rebounds few games ago.
	Eric Nguyen boring
