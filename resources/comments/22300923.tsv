	NBA better watch out, the Domin-Ayton's domination about to start!!
	😂
	His inconsistency has half of the fan base  totally out on him, but if he could get even 20% more consistent with performance and availability, he could be a fringe all-star player.
	For the casuals, he's been balling out the last 10-15 games in a row. In no way am I excusing his apprent lack of motor, but he's definitely starting to find a fit.
	Better than Softic from the Suns
	Todd A. Norin -Really? Softic grabbed 31 rebounds few games ago.
	Eric Nguyen boring
	Todd A. Norin
	Dominayton once every 15 games
	Ayton got two nights worth of stats into just one!
	Well done Deandre 🤔
	Against a team without a starting center!
	That’s what we need close to every game 😎
	William Stevens he’ll give you one more. Then take 2 months off
	🤣
	Brandon Matthew  that negativity escalated quickly
	William Stevens Lol. It’s from 5 years of watching and waiting

	To bad he ain’t consistent 😂😂😂

	Kathy Watkins  he’s never consistent
