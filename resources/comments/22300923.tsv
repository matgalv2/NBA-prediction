	NBA better watch out, the Domin-Ayton's domination about to start!!
	 what makes you so sure about that 😂
	His inconsistency has half of the fan base  totally out on him, but if he could get even 20% more consistent with performance and availability, he could be a fringe all-star player.
	For the casuals, he's been balling out the last 10-15 games in a row. In no way am I excusing his apprent lack of motor, but he's definitely starting to find a fit.
	Better than Softic from the Suns
	 -Really? Softic grabbed 31 rebounds few games ago.
	 boring
	
	Dominayton once every 15 games
	Against a team without a starting center!
	Ayton got two nights worth of stats into just one!
	Well done Deandre 🤔
	To bad he ain’t consistent 😂😂😂
	That’s what we need close to every game 😎
	 he’ll give you one more. Then take 2 months off
	   Lmfao 🤣
	  that negativity escalated quickly
	 Lol. It’s from 5 years of watching and waiting
	  I understand the pain lol 🤙🏽
	Congratulations Blazers 🏀🏆
	Right were he left off
	Deandre Ayton
	nice
	Dominayton
	The most inconsistent player in the NBA ☻️🧐🥴
	Pelea de inválidos
	 spominjali smo ga nekidan i uspoređivali sa Nurkićem..
	 Nekonstantan je, ne da nikome loptu, neće izaći da napravi blok i odigra pick&amp;roll, doslovno najbeskorisniji igrač za ekipu. A ogromaaan talenat ima. Kralj beznačajne statistike. Talentovaniji i od KAT-a i od Embiida, ali meni se čini da se njemu svaka druga utakmica igra.
	 istina. Takav je bio prvih par sezona i očekivalo se da sazrije, napreduje, preboli te dječje bolesti a on do danas ostao isti..A po potencijalu novi Hakeem ili Robinson..
	if we had scottie and poertle and the rest of the guys, we could’ve easily one that game. i was there and i could see miscommunication and all that.
	Dominayton!
	The snow melted…
	very love it
	RIP CITTTYYYYY
	18-35 shesh 😂😂😂😂
