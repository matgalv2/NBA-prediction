	Humble and great player.. way better than lebron and not even close
	 a lot of players today are better than Lebron, a few that he is not even close to. Why the need to bring him up? 🤣
	 you 🤡🤡
	 rent free
	yes not even close. 1 championship vs 4. not even close. humble and great player wasting time trying to shoot a freethrow that'll eventually miss 🤡🤡🤡🤡
	 Malayo pa si giannis kay lebron kahit si durant nga malayo ehh
	 Hater kalang ng isang lebron hahaha bano rin naman giannis travel lagi bano pa sa ft hahaha
	Wow, that's incredible! Giannis Antetokounmpo is truly a dominant force on the court. It's amazing that he joined the elite group of players with 20 career 35/15/5 games. The Bucks must be thrilled with the win! 🏀🔥
	Predic, east finals showdown with knicks. Yes milwaukee can beat celtics in a defensive game 7.
	Never ending records. Records that don't matter.
	I’d still take Dirk over him
	 you need your head examined.
	 aight after you 😉
	 boy believe me, it’s been evaluated multiple times and I have no shame in it. 🤷🏼‍♀️ It’s your turn.
	 me too that makes us Double 😉. Or maybe I’m just that old school lmao . And your right I got no shame too 🤷🏻‍♂️. But yeah Dirk all day
	 funny man
	 there’s more baby . This is nothing lmao jk
	 I understand 😂
	 haha 😂 gotta know me to find out
	 Dirk is retired so this comment is useless
	 True just want to give him his Flowers and credit . It’s Giannis’ Time now
	 I would if Dirk was half as effective on defense
	 Exactly but that’s what Teammates are for right lmao jk 🤷🏻‍♂️. Yeah we all know he a liability on that end . Good point
	 dirk is no way can guard giannis 😝
	"""I wish i could just be 7 feet and travel and dunk"""
	did not know bots can cry
	 that’s why God denied u
	 LaBron travels on almost every spin move with that little double foot rabbit hop.
	i'm not hating, just stating facts! And yes, not just Lebron, most stars travels a lot too!
	 i wouldn't take someone who name is joker serious
	 everybody travels lol you travel lol
	Ayoooo! lol
	 just admit you don’t watch giannis play if this is how you feel. 
	Bucks lost to the Celtics, Celtics lost to the Hawks, Hawks lost to the Bucks
	 bucks lost to the pelicans Celtics beat the pelicans
	 yeah, but they were without Giannis and the Celtics just barely beat them. Makes me wonder.
	 bucks also blew the Celtics out of the water
	These stats are great when you also win the game!!!
	well deserved win Giannis💯🏀🦌🤝🤝💪💪💪
	Time for trae young to go to gsw
	 gsw need Jesus.
	 yea some players need to be raptured for good. Especially those with the four rings gesture...
	And a center.
	The future of the NBA, and the future GOAT, heir to the throne of King James 🤣😅😂😁
	I thought the hawks would beat this bucks the way they beat the Celtics, well the game's done... GGWP🤟🤟
	Milwaukee Bucks Vs Atlanta Hawks
