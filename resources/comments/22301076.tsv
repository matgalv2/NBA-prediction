MIL	Humble and great player.. way better than lebron and not even close
MIL	Wow, that's incredible! Giannis Antetokounmpo is truly a dominant force on the court. It's amazing that he joined the elite group of players with 20 career 35/15/5 games. The Bucks must be thrilled with the win! 🏀🔥
MIL	Never ending records. Records that don't matter.
	Eigger Jaeger you don’t think records matter to the athletes who live and breathe their respective sport? And the fans who love the sport enough to respect the history? I’m certain they do.
	Eliza Schaeffer the records that they bring out today is just almost specific. Records matters but not that they give specific numbers like this one. Tell me what's next record they will bring? Like someone records a 20 10 10 with 50% fg for the first time.  Is that even a thing today? There is no never ending
MIL	I’d still take Dirk over him
	"""I wish i could just be 7 feet and travel and dunk"""
