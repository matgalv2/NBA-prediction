	 cringe
	Rey Perez the Celtics are the most super team in the nba
	thank you pelicans, lakeshow top 6 continues 🤭
	 64 79 half time
	 still not over although
	 it's over
	 I know Lakers win
	 so scared to face gsw in play in,.
	Im here for the amount of typos this year
	The fact that the Suns don't even have 50 wins this year and they have the same record as the pelicans but yet they have so much more talent is a disgrace.
	 do they really have more talent?
	, and we beat em without BI.
	This win is good for Lakers. They have a higher  chance to be in 6th spot. Lets Gow.!!
	 64 79 halftime
	 win first vs twolves 🤣
	Dallas win
	 lakers also loss tonight lol
	Go Pelicans
	Great win after the loss to San Antonio.
	 it's okay 
	 i think so
	What’s going on with the Suns?
	46-32  both for the 🌙 City and Phoenix 🌞 on the eclipse 👽
	Let’s go Lakers
	Hold on: we need a playoff game! Both teams have the same record!
	Zion Williamson heating up
	At least the Suns won the tiebreaker. Are 2-1 against them this year
	Really..but the warrior always beat the lakers
	Lakers fans right now 😎
	The secon King of floop of NBA

	The new brigade in the league starting to really take flight now. causing hell trouble for the older superstars.
	Zion will be out for 3 weeks after that effort
	 lol
	How do you forget to add the 5 blocks … Zion was great on both ends.
	His smile is infectious.
	New Orleans Pelicans Vs Phoenix Suns
	Zion is a joke
	Mount Zion💪
	He IS looking more fit these days.
	Cj,no Zion
	Happy for zion
	The next labron to hanip glawang laberon tlga

	Being the $188m winner of the 2015powerball jackpot is a great gain. I vowed to help people in need of financial support, Being blessed with $188m dollars really meant a lot to me and I feel like I don’t deserve it as I know the real struggle people go through in a bid to make ends meet. Therefore I voluntarily decided to donate and touch the lives of men and women who have found themselves in financial crisis, to individuals around the world according to how God leads me to do. I try to reach people randomly from different sources and modes so as to touch lives from different parts of the world. Now I’m giving you an opportunity to share your pain with me drop a message for me and I'll reply you. Respectfully:
