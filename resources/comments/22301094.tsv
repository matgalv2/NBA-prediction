TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Thanks D’Angelo Russell For That Outstanding Performance!😃😃😃
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate just love #Lebron not a Goat nor a king 💪
	LeBron james is the greatest player ever
	Let’s win our remaining games and hope for the best. Hopefully get as high as the 7th seed. Let’s go Lakers! 👌👍🙌✌️🙏👏🤞❤️
	Back On Track Boys. LET'S GOOOOOO
	Akie Webbe Are you a betting man or just a talker
	Perry Barbour why
	Great job Lakers
	Great win my Lakers if DLO and Rui and AR can help out LeBron and AD and if my Lakers make the playoffs it's possible we can win the whole thing 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛
	Let’s make it to the playoffs 👑🔥🏆
	Delphena Franklin The daddy Sylver….
	Sebastien Courtier what ??
	So glad the Lakers didn't trade D'Angelo Russell.
	Sean Meyers, they should’ve traded LeBron
	Lebron's injury no more🤣
	Nice W, Lakers!!

	Lakers fans be like: all top teams are avoiding us in the first round.
	ฤสอฟพำผ ทรแ้ฟำสI'm a Laker but afraid not just Denver but Suns or kings can eliminate LAL on the playoffs. Dallas also playing in a high level now
	Liander Silvaso the okc can't???
	ฤสอฟพำผ ทรแ้ฟำสOKC also playing  very well and I expect a great performance on the playoffs but against Lakers was 1-3 on the regular so as a laker I'll be more worried with the ones I mentioned
	All for a play in spot lol
	Keep it going going Lakers 💜💛💪
	We’re going to playoffs baby
	I love how much celebration there is after beating one of the worst teams in the league
	Congratulations Lakers 🏀🏆

	One more gimme game for the Lakers against the Wizards, then the NBA refs will go back to the ridiculous foul and free throw discrepencies to make sure the Lakers beat the Cavs, Wolves, and GSW.

	Just in time Dlo..
	Good luck 🍀
	Great job by D'Angelo Russell and the Lakers for securing the win against the Raptors! Russell's impressive clutch performance from beyond the arc definitely played a huge role in their victory. And let's not forget the strong performances by Anthony Davis and RJ Barrett as well. Looking forward to more exciting games like this! #LakeShow #NBA
