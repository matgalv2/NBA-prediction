	Thanks D’Angelo Russell For That Outstanding Performance!😃😃😃
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate just love <a class=
	LeBron james is the greatest player ever
	Let’s win our remaining games and hope for the best. Hopefully get as high as the 7th seed. Let’s go Lakers! 👌👍🙌✌️🙏👏🤞❤️
	Back On Track Boys. LET'S GOOOOOO
	 Are you a betting man or just a talker
	Great job Lakers
	Let’s make it to the playoffs 👑🔥🏆
	Great win my Lakers if DLO and Rui and AR can help out LeBron and AD and if my Lakers make the playoffs it's possible we can win the whole thing 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛
	All for a play in spot lol
	So glad the Lakers didn't trade D'Angelo Russell.
	, they should’ve traded LeBron
	Lebron's injury no more🤣
	Lakers fans be like: all top teams are avoiding us in the first round.
	I'm a Laker but afraid not just Denver but Suns or kings can eliminate LAL on the playoffs. Dallas also playing in a high level now
	so the okc can't???
	OKC also playing  very well and I expect a great performance on the playoffs but against Lakers was 1-3 on the regular so as a laker I'll be more worried with the ones I mentioned
	Nice W, Lakers!!
	Add me up and inbox
	Keep it going going Lakers 💜💛💪
	I love how much celebration there is after beating one of the worst teams in the league
	How is it clutch when you have 19 pt lead?
	Congratulations Lakers 🏀🏆

	Great Win For The Lakers 💜💛 On The Road
	One more gimme game for the Lakers against the Wizards, then the NBA refs will go back to the ridiculous foul and free throw discrepencies to make sure the Lakers beat the Cavs, Wolves, and GSW.
	Just in time Dlo..
	Good luck 🍀
	Great job by D'Angelo Russell and the Lakers for securing the win against the Raptors! Russell's impressive clutch performance from beyond the arc definitely played a huge role in their victory. And let's not forget the strong performances by Anthony Davis and RJ Barrett as well. Looking forward to more exciting games like this!  
	Lakers are still getting swept by Denver in the first round 😂😂😂
	All lakers players r clutch against a terrible team ....
	So wait he did this with lebron on the court imagine that I thought he could play with lebron again lbj don’t affect u bro g aggressive and make shots
