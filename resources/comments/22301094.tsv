	ฤสอฟพำผ ทรแ้ฟำสI'm a Laker but afraid not just Denver but Suns or kings can eliminate LAL on the playoffs. Dallas also playing in a high level now
	Liander Silvaso the okc can't???
	ฤสอฟพำผ ทรแ้ฟำสOKC also playing  very well and I expect a great performance on the playoffs but against Lakers was 1-3 on the regular so as a laker I'll be more worried with the ones I mentioned
LAL	All for a play in spot lol
LAL	Keep it going going Lakers 💜💛💪

	One more gimme game for the Lakers against the Wizards, then the NBA refs will go back to the ridiculous foul and free throw discrepencies to make sure the Lakers beat the Cavs, Wolves, and GSW.

LAL	Great job by D'Angelo Russell and the Lakers for securing the win against the Raptors! Russell's impressive clutch performance from beyond the arc definitely played a huge role in their victory. And let's not forget the strong performances by Anthony Davis and RJ Barrett as well. Looking forward to more exciting games like this! #LakeShow #NBA
