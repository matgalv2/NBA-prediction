	Fox &amp; Sabonis will always be All-Stars and knock the crap out of every team they encounter. They have been done a GREAT INJUSTICE! The league is full of injustices like this. The league just cares about $$$. Give them time to rest and then let them ROAR and ROAR they will!
	Destroy each and every team in the regular season and come playoff time.
	And 31 straight double-doubles for Sabonis. Had a triple double tonight! ☝🏽
