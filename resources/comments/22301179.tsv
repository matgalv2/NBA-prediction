	The problem of the bucks is they won't let thanasis be the starter of the game.

	Nice work, Chet!!!
	👋
	Chet is one of the major factors the OKC are tied with Wolves and Nuggets
	Pinoy memes why I don't understand how they have Shai over luka in MVP ladder considering OKC have Chet who goes off and Williams who been going off this season to help them win yet we see the mavs team without luka
	so, this game is the reason Shai got ahead of Luka for MVP? 🤣🤣
	Ivan Vulić No haha
	Ivan Vulić that and the fact that the Thunder went like 2-6 without Shai
	its doc rivers and its playoff time so goodbye bucks
	Bucks first round exit confirmed 😩😭💀🤣
	All fun and games until LeBron sweeps OKC or the Timberpups in the first round 😩😭💀🤣
	OKC a great young team. Very bright future ahead. If this team stays for the next 2-3 yrs, improve more and add maturity. I wont be surprised if they win the chip.
	Bucks is in trouble....Doc Rivers needs to quit. Reality is, all teams that Doc Rivers coached are total disapppintments despite having strong lineups.😢
	pag lakers makatapat OKC na to sa plaoffs!! cancungan bagsak ninyo agad sa 1st round haha.. 1st seed nga pro wala nmn playoff experience..iba ang laro pg playoffs!! kumpara sa regular season, kasi talas ng galaw at isipan sa laro at teknik lalabas na lalo na c LBJ grabi mga vision at plano mglaro tapos ung team nya my playoff exeprience na lahat.. kaya goodluck na lang sa inyo OKC boys..haha..
	😂😂😂😂
	🤣🤭
	JhOn GrEy Kalag Magwelz galit na galit ah? Pagdasal mo muna makalagpas ng play-in ang lakers lol
	😂😂😂
	Never seen a blackenese nba player ever 👀
	Jess Pulutan Youre so ignorant 
	Popovich is gonna have the spurs at the top of the west next year. Pop is the Goat
	It's no 34, 12, and 5 but nice try chet!
	yeah the thunders and wolves will be out in round one or the second round it's a repeat of last season.

	James Asher Van Sickle I don’t think so. The Thunder were not even a .500 team last year. No they are 1st in the west. It’s clear some progress has been made.
	Aren't the Wolves the 1 seed because of conference record??
	Connor LeClair the first tie breaker goes to the team with the best record among the top 3
	Connor LeClair No.
	Connor LeClair in a 3 way tie, OKC has the better combined record vs the the other 2.
	Connor LeClair because it's a 3-way tie, it's total vs record against those 3 teams. OKC is 5-3, MIN is 4-4, and DEN is 3-5.
	Bobby Lee really playing well
	Where do they have that tiebreaker from? Can someone tell me?
	Christian Gold It’s because okc won the regular season series against both of them
	Jeryd Derilo not against the wolves. Wolves technically have the tie breaker against the Thunder because they’re tied divisional
	Jeryd Derilo true. But why wouldn't it go off conference record first
	Jeryd Derilo nice try, but the Timberwolves went 2-2 against the Thunder.  They did win 3-1 against Denver, but if either Denver or OKC loses, and the Timberwolves win, the Timberwolves will move back to #1, because they have the best conference record… Wyświetl więcej
	Christian Gold if 3 of them Won the Last Game Thunder is still the #1 because of there win or loose record.
	Chet looks ready to go home and play ps5.
	Be Number one seed is very dangerous cause warrios and lakers
	Okc young boys pit Lillard
	So are they locked in for the #1 seed?
	Lamont Mar no yet,have to win their final game
	Lamont Mar  1 More Game
	Lamont Mar noo last game are must wins for each team
	congrats chris newsome lakas mo tlga lodzzz
	Lhesz Ther may sense of humor kadin talaga boss e no
	Wolves are first
	😂
	Donald Brown Um. No.
	Donald Brown No
	Is that future

	Pricetag

	Lakas makatawa ni newsome ah
	Lagot kayo sa LAKERS.. easy win yan..
	SGA mvp🔥
	idk john legend plays okla
	Chet should be ROY but the league wants to hype wemby so I guess not.
	Duke Dennis 👀👀
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	OKC thunder are scary good!
	Marlon Onco cept lakers have owned them all season.
	😆.
	Marlon Onco yep lol
	Manando Atm Cebza or that Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with Spoon engines
	"Wolves just got HOSEDDDDDD! 3rd Tiebreaker is combined ""vs. record"" between OKC/MIN/DEN?! it should be H2H, Division Record then Conference Record 🤬"
	Damien Kowal Okc is 3-1 against Denver and Minn is 2-2 against Denver. Okc and Minn are tied up 2-2. Minn didn't get hosed. Okc has the better record in the top 3.
	Mitchell McCoy dumbest tiebreaker in the history of sports.
	Damien Kowal Naw, that would be the three way tie between Texas, OU, and Tech when Michael Crabtree played. Oklahoma came out on top of that one too.
	3rd seed will be as safest spot. Nobody wants Lakers or suns in the 1st round of playoffs.
	Jonathan Peralta Mendoza the suns is who everybody wants.
	I aint know duke dennis is in the NBA
	Chet &amp; Wemby are the most best Center now...🏀💪👍😜
	Congrats price tag
	Good Job Doc
