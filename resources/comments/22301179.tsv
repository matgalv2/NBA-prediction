	The problem of the bucks is they won't let thanasis be the starter of the game.
	Nice work, Chet!!!
	Chet is one of the major factors the OKC are tied with Wolves and Nuggets
	so, this game is the reason Shai got ahead of Luka for MVP? 🤣🤣
	Bucks first round exit confirmed 😩😭💀🤣
	its doc rivers and its playoff time so goodbye bucks
	OKC a great young team. Very bright future ahead. If this team stays for the next 2-3 yrs, improve more and add maturity. I wont be surprised if they win the chip.
	Bucks is in trouble....Doc Rivers needs to quit. Reality is, all teams that Doc Rivers coached are total disapppintments despite having strong lineups.😢
	Never seen a blackenese nba player ever 👀
	Popovich is gonna have the spurs at the top of the west next year. Pop is the Goat
	It's no 34, 12, and 5 but nice try chet!
	Aren't the Wolves the 1 seed because of conference record??
	yeah the thunders and wolves will be out in round one or the second round it's a repeat of last season.
	Chet looks ready to go home and play ps5.
	Bobby Lee really playing well
	Where do they have that tiebreaker from? Can someone tell me?
	So are they locked in for the #1 seed?
	Be Number one seed is very dangerous cause warrios and lakers
	Okc young boys pit Lillard
	Wolves are first
	Is that future
	💚🦌🏀🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
	Awesome
	SGA mvp🔥
	Duke Dennis 👀👀
	Chet should be ROY but the league wants to hype wemby so I guess not.
	This doesn't change the fact that Lakers will be the 2024 NBA champions LeBron MVP
	OKC thunder are scary good!
	 3-1, okay 😆.
	I aint know duke dennis is in the NBA
	Wolves just got HOSEDDDDDD! 3rd Tiebreaker is combined 
	 Okc is 3-1 against Denver and Minn is 2-2 against Denver. Okc and Minn are tied up 2-2. Minn didn't get hosed. Okc has the better record in the top 3.
	 dumbest tiebreaker in the history of sports.
	3rd seed will be as safest spot. Nobody wants Lakers or suns in the 1st round of playoffs.
	Congrats price tag
	Good Job Doc
	Chet &amp; Wemby are the most best Center now...🏀💪👍😜
	Lovely 🥰
