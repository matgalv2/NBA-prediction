	Rockets went on that losing streak after trying to troll the Warriors with that Warriors come out and play shirt. Now look at you eliminated from playoff contention after possibly trying to jump them in the standings last week 🤣 🖕
	Robert Greenley They have been eliminated since last Saturday they picked the wrong time to have a 10 game winning streak and conversely following it with a 6 game losing streak still doesn't take away the awesome job that Ume Udouka did with this team💯
	 at this point the dubs are rookie killers. So many young teams they've shut down past few years 😂😂
	" spot on comment...all these young guys Celtics stars included think you do it for a week a month or even a season that they are now the man...few good games and wins and people start to feel themselves and lose focus love the humble tea… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
