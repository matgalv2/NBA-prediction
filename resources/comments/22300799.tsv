TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
OKC	Thanks for giving us SGA, Clippers 👍
OKC	Impressed, not convinced they’re ready to go deep in the playoffs yet, but getting warmer. SGA is smooth, and as long as Chet can stay healthy he’s legit.
OKC	Not his fan but he's the MVP right now..
	Jason Melanio yeah, if we exclude Jokic, SGA is most certainly no 1
	Marko Velimirovic no even with joker.
	Jason Melanio overrated
OKC	Clippers punching the air for letting this man go!
OKC	OKC ain't gone win a got dam thing watch clippers will bounce back
OKC	Donald Ray Justice Sr. They the old thunder but they can’t fw the new thunder 💯
OKC	Donald Ray Justice Sr. Won more than 69% of their games so far.  Which is more than any team other than Boston and Minnesota can say, bozo.
LAC	Maybe you should rest more of the Clippers to pace them for the offseason.
OKC	SGA on his way 🔥🏀💯
	1. Jokic
OKC	That was a great game.
OKC	Go okc
LAC	Two Los Angeles Teams Loss tonight.
OKC	MVP Him
OKC	Mvp !
OKC	First round exit for OKC
OKC	Yessir!. ⚡
OKC	Way to go Thunder
	Revenge game
OKC	Mvp
OKC	Shai for MVP 😊
	Mvp
OKC	Nice
LAC	Clippers definitely didn’t win the trade.. sorry but SGA and Jalen Williams are a better duo than PG and KW sorry. They have beat the clippers by 22 and 19 this yr. 🙌. Thunder up
LAC	As a clippers fan I’m salty about this trade
	You know the team has gotten back into the mix when instead of people screaming you suck, they just scream that you'll have a first round exit. I'll take that for a team that only had 40 wins last year and no playoff time.
	Los Angeles Clippers Vs Oklahoma City Thunder
LAC	Mvp kawhi
OKC	Shai really standing on bidness
	Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
	joker 21pts 19 rebounds 15 assists! 
	"Filipino bandwagon fans that keep commenting ""first round exit/second round exit"" in these NBA pages they are just jealous to the top teams because their favorite teams are SH*T 💩💩"
	Esto fue un juegoo que el thunder se vio tirando más de campo de los mismo Clippers el Thunder le llevo 10.4 a los Clippers de campo algo que thunder iba ganar ese juego como sea Por qué de tres tiraron mejor también el equipo de Oklahoma el thunder tu… Wyświetl więcej
LAC	Clippers have got to be top three most overrated teams this year. They old, washed, load management scrubs.
OKC	That's my MVP⚡🔵🟠🟡
OKC	Lets go!!! Shai Mvp ⚡️⚡️⚡️
	meet consistency man
	My guys
OKC	The Lip💋

SPAM	Things are kinda tough atm especially this time of the year so l’m going gifting 5 grands to the first 7 people to message me with “ASSIST” let’s spread love and end inhumanity.
OKC	This Shai Alexander is fuckin good
OKC	Imagine trading SGA and 5 first round picks for a washed Paul George. Clippers will find a way.
	John Junior Raesen The Clippers dont sign there GM Kawhi unless they pulled that trade off.
	John Junior Raesen definitely not washed lol and SGA was a unknown they don't get Kawhi without PG everyone who knows ball knows that. Besides with Doc Rivers had they stayed together they still lose in the bubble 😩😩😩
	John Junior Raesen no regrets. Both played well and both teams on top of the standings...
	John Junior Raesen without PG trade clippers don't get the Kawhi ,  and SGA is not exactly young his 26 only start playing great this year, we not sure if he can make a deep run in the playoffs So Relax it was a great trade for both sides
OKC	Thunder up! ⚡️
