ATL	It’ll be the same thing in the playoffs. We just chuck up 3’s and hope that we’re hot that night.
BOS	Absolutely a huge embarrassing loss for the Celtics
BOS	🤣🤣💯
	Macfam Kendrell yea like they did the last 30 years and won only 1
ATL	agreed Keith. And no young for the hawks as well. Defensively horrible game , way too many open looks for Atlanta and Clint just muscled out our “big” men as well.
	Keith Sison sé coherente,de verdad crees que Atlanta está para ganarle una serie a Boston?????
	🤣
	Keith Sison absolutely
BOS	🤣 they locked up #1 seed
	Keith Sison had 2 starters out and bench players. They didn’t care
	Keith Sison absolutely does not matter lol
ATL	There have been so many blowouts and so few comebacks this year.  Great to see Hawks fighting for the W instead of just lying down and taking the night off.
BOS	Boston Celtics couldn't finish the deal on the Atlanta Hawks
	Joseph Thompson like they were trying to
	the ball is round. 🤣
ATL	Well deserved Win 👏🏾
ATL	That's how hard it is to finish games and series. Especially with a team that does not have championship experience. They need to add someone that has been there.
BOS	Celtics just getting ready for the playoffs lol.

	Ha Yura sounds about right!!!
BOS	Celtics don't need to win any more regular season games.
BOS	I mean Boston already clinched the conference, so….
