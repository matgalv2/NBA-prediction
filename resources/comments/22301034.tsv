	It’ll be the same thing in the playoffs. We just chuck up 3’s and hope that we’re hot that night.
	Absolutely a huge embarrassing loss for the Celtics
	 i dont think they gaf look at the récords Boston almost at 60 wins i know Boston was up 30 But Boston already in the playoffs 🤣🤣💯
	 yea like they did the last 30 years and won only 1
	agreed Keith. And no young for the hawks as well. Defensively horrible game , way too many open looks for Atlanta and Clint just muscled out our “big” men as well.
	 sé coherente,de verdad crees que Atlanta está para ganarle una serie a Boston?????
	 not really lmao. They don’t care. They could’ve won this game if they wanted but they rather stay healthy for the playoffs 🤣
	 absolutely
	 why? They got nothing to play for. They been resting starters for 2 weeks🤣 they locked up #1 seed
	 had 2 starters out and bench players. They didn’t care
	 absolutely does not matter lol
	There have been so many blowouts and so few comebacks this year.  Great to see Hawks fighting for the W instead of just lying down and taking the night off.
	Boston Celtics couldn't finish the deal on the Atlanta Hawks
	 like they were trying to
	the ball is round. 🤣
	Well deserved Win 👏🏾
	That's how hard it is to finish games and series. Especially with a team that does not have championship experience. They need to add someone that has been there.
	Celtics just getting ready for the playoffs lol.
	Celtics don't need to win any more regular season games.
	Boston Celchokes
	I mean Boston already clinched the conference, so….
	This doesn't change the Fact that LeBron James is the Greatest Player ever in the History of the NBA
	Não é como começa mais sim como termina 🏀🤫 Atlanta Hawks 🇦🇴
	something about NBA that I don't know anything about, add me and throw me in please 🥰🙏
	Yeah Bucks in 6
	 bucks in 5
	 in 6? They might sweep!
	No young no double o no Jalen Johnson wow Celtics just didn't want to win tonight😅
	Solid team. Only 7 games back of 500
	📣 Joe M. Let's secure the W next time Goo C's
	Cels started their playoff run early I see 😭
	The Celtics made folks who bet on ATL happy. Not saying they tanked the game but it was a gift. 😝
	BOTH TEAM WAS IN PLAYOFF MODE
	Great job Dre.  He was clutch from free throws to the last shot.  Go Hawks!
	Boston Celtics Vs Atlanta Hawks
	Hawks superbowl
	Shempre may lalait na naman sa Boston dyan🤣
	 mataas kasi expectation nila sa boston kaya bawal matalo boston hahah

	where the tatum for mvp guys at?
	28-3 is the only thing that should've matter, but oh well.
	pag kulilat kalaban hirap manalo boston
	I wish Hunter could average this
	The defending regular season champs Boston Celtics just blew a 30 point lead as a tribute to Sam Hauser! 🍀😤😩😭💀🤣
	Came from Charlottesville VA University good job keeping on moving on💯💙💯💙
	Boston doing what they do best except it's not play-offs yet. Choking. 🤣30 points up what the!
	He looks like the son of Shawn Kemp!
	De'Andre Hunter was gunning for Boston Celtics
	How in the world do you give up a 30 point lead? unreal
	Am diehard celtics fan but d way Tatum n brown having d ball on crucial minutes is disastrous to d team with their ball handling n way of dribbling
	Celtics lose, another win for NBA fans
	The sicily group are very much alive
	Boston is already lock in they are chilling
	Great game
	Ndi na mahalaga sa boston yan kht matalo pa
	 really?it hurts 30 points ahead and loss ny 2?cant sleep.hahaha.
	Pippen’s son
	nakaka iyak yon HAHAHA partida wala pa si Trae 😆
	Celtics doing Tatum things and I love it 😁
	 this one was a classic bru I could not believe it .but Celtics was to relaxed after a big 30 point lead .

	U can't be world champ the way you blew a 30-pt lead. NBA games are played &amp;decided in 4 quarters. U don't win in the 1st two then relax in the 3rd &amp;4th. This has been the team's history.
	"IM Paying 6Grands For The First 8 People To Message Me With ""FAITH”Cause"
	He look like Wesley snipes in that Kevin hart Netflix joint
	They lost to the Atlanta Warriors?
	And people say that’s the best team in the NBA??? ☠️🤣🤡
	 first team to 50 wins and the only team under 20 losses so say what you want
	 this season may be plenty teams have done it🤣☠️
	 lost to the Hawks while having a 30 point lead without Trae Young☠️🤣 embarrassing
	 that's the wrong with people imagine winning 50 games and getting discredited with 1 game on two points deficit loss.
	De'Andre Hunter
	You can call it Deandre Curry no Deandre Hunter, Hunter it's look like Curry
	Its really upset
	how you be down by 1 and shoot a fadeaway three at crunch time 🤦🏽‍♂️

	Jaylen Brown is a sore loser, Boston not making the Finals
	 kinda like someone else we all know runs to the back when he's losing
	Relax hater. This without perimeter defender Jrue and Derrick White. Relax. Where is your Warriors right now? Haha
	 that was without Trae for the hawks lol 😂 how come you morons assume everyone's a warriors fan? You a hater?
	 Celtics are gonna choke in the 2nd round or conference finals. Boston is soft.
	 Who won the Last year Playoff Hawks vs Celtics? With Trae in line up. Tell me. Hawks no chance to Boston and thats reality 🤣🤣
	 who won tn? Does the playoff series last year make any difference this year or did it tn? No lol 😂
	 did the hawks get lucky yeah but last years playoffs didn't help the Celtics tn did it?
	 no it didn't thanks for mentioning that!
	 that's like saying 5 years ago the wolves beat the clippers in the playoffs so that impacted their next game...duhhhhhh lol yay Celtics won last year and lost tn yay!!
	" and I'm not sure what your point is cause they didn't need Trae tn and won so again the Celtics series win last year meant nothing tn even with Trae out lol 😂 most irrelevant fact you brought up! Celtics lost but they won last year… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
