TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	That's on 14/18 FG. Someone on the YouTube NBA channel for this game referred to J-Dub as the new Kawhi. Never thought about it until now, but I think that's a great comparison and compliment!
	 it is. They’re both medium sized forwards with insane wingspans, insane mid range shots (j-dub is shooting 54/44/82 splits), high IQ defense.
	Alex Pavchinski I wouldn't go that far since Leonard is an all-time great. Williams isn't that polished defensively. He's more Pierce or George.
	JDub is such a beast. He's so strong. That dunk when the defender bounced off of him was impressive, and that chase down block was nasty. Guy has a very high ceiling. I really hope OKC can keep him and Shai and Chet together for a long time. Hopefully Giddey as well.
	 JDub will win most improved player of the year
	Gg heart breaking loss by my Knicks but okc is good they remind me of the young KD squad their gonna be top threats for a while and y’all still got first round picks as well if I’m correct I’m definitely excited to see okc in the playoffs. Free throws was the difference maker tonight
	 what do you mean about free throws? The Knicks were +10 free throw attempts, and OKC was atrocious from the free throw line, going 12 for 24.
	 they missed free throws and lost by a point that definitely was a difference maker for both teams
	 the game wouldn't have been close if OKC had made their free throws at their normal rate. They shoot 83% from the free throw line as a team, so 12/24 was very out of character.
	 Hey sweetie 😘 I got some nasty sweet juicy content and I'm also available for meet ups HMU back if Interested
	Thunder UP! ⚡️⚡️
	The Hoop Collective Podcast is gonna be lit in the morning I just know
	It's be crazy when you need 17.5 from this guy he gives you 8. Then tonight he give you a 30 piece.
	Okc like 13 - 5 against the top 5 seeded teams eastern and western conference... the only teams they can't beat are the teams that have legit big men
	Most underrated player in the NBA, he the reason OKC best in west most of the season , and just a good as Dort on Defense ￼
	Okc going to be eliminated in 1st round
	They got out of jail that game!!
	Whatever we get the playoffs first
	Whoever team that the Okc will face in the playoffs will surely going to have a tough time beating this young guns. Even theres Shai, have experience being in that situation before in his Clippers days. Adding up Hayward, still the unexperienced in that arena as a whole group will show up. But for sure they will compete in the playoffs.
	No OG to lockdown defence
	2nd youngest team out for blood!
	Don't forget vietnam war

	J-Dub is incredibly underrated. We lucked out no one else drafted him because he’s been a huge part of our foundation this season.

	congrats but lakeshow gonna destroy your team in the playoffs mark my word💪
	Such a sexy player the way he plays every time he touches the ball!
	KD is like I’m coming home
	Wait til OG is guarding him all up in his grill with that wingspan. Guarantee he won’t go 15-20 on us! Add OG hitting some threes (the Thunder length and hustle on close outs  made it tough for Donte and Deuce, who are smaller than OG and Randle, of course). And Randle is a bucket and foul shot getter. So I’m not worried about. Williams is great, but he was in mismatches all night.
