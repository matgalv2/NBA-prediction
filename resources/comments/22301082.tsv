TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	That's on 14/18 FG. Someone on the YouTube NBA channel for this game referred to J-Dub as the new Kawhi. Never thought about it until now, but I think that's a great comparison and compliment!
OKC	JDub is such a beast. He's so strong. That dunk when the defender bounced off of him was impressive, and that chase down block was nasty. Guy has a very high ceiling. I really hope OKC can keep him and Shai and Chet together for a long time. Hopefully Giddey as well.
NYK	Gg heart breaking loss by my Knicks but okc is good they remind me of the young KD squad their gonna be top threats for a while and y’all still got first round picks as well if I’m correct I’m definitely excited to see okc in the playoffs. Free throws was the difference maker tonight
OKC	Thunder UP! ⚡️⚡️
	The Hoop Collective Podcast is gonna be lit in the morning I just know
OKC	It's be crazy when you need 17.5 from this guy he gives you 8. Then tonight he give you a 30 piece.
OKC	Okc like 13 - 5 against the top 5 seeded teams eastern and western conference... the only teams they can't beat are the teams that have legit big men
OKC	Most underrated player in the NBA, he the reason OKC best in west most of the season , and just a good as Dort on Defense ￼
OKC	Okc going to be eliminated in 1st round
	Aciel Abimanyu just a hater
	Kelton Loomis not at all,  just being realistic. In fact, we ve seen many playoffs nowadays, which 8th or 7th seed goes to semifinal or finals. Its money time.
	Aciel Abimanyu that’s not realistic at all… 1 seeds rarely go out first round
NYK	😑😑
	🙃
OKC	They got out of jail that game!!
OKC	Whoever team that the Okc will face in the playoffs will surely going to have a tough time beating this young guns. Even theres Shai, have experience being in that situation before in his Clippers days. Adding up Hayward, still the unexperienced in that arena as a whole group will show up. But for sure they will compete in the playoffs.
	No OG to lockdown defence
	2nd youngest team out for blood!
	Don't forget vietnam war
OKC	GREAT JOB Guys!!!
OKC	Oklahoma City Thunder tylko jednym punktem. New York Knicks głowa do góry ...

OKC	J-Dub is incredibly underrated. We lucked out no one else drafted him because he’s been a huge part of our foundation this season.
	U don't drink faucet water, but u got ice cubes in your drink...... let's go LSU!
	Nuggets fan here... It's not OKC time YET... They haven't got the playoffs exp or battle tested now, but they will be a problem next year and for years to come... Glad to see they did it the right way home grown... They can thank Clippers for taking PG and giving them Shai and all them 1st Rd picks lol
OKC	congrats but lakeshow gonna destroy your team in the playoffs mark my word💪
OKC	Such a sexy player the way he plays every time he touches the ball!
NYK	Wait til OG is guarding him all up in his grill with that wingspan. Guarantee he won’t go 15-20 on us! Add OG hitting some threes (the Thunder length and hustle on close outs  made it tough for Donte and Deuce, who are smaller than OG and Randle, of course). And Randle is a bucket and foul shot getter. So I’m not worried about. Williams is great, but he was in mismatches all night.
	Ronald Bansak II
OKC	👊🏽Awesome W I N guys!!
OKC	⚡💥⚡
OKC	Josh Giddey with a Triple Double
