	Great game GS! Let's win out!!
	Nahhhhh. Additional drama. The playoffs is complete. NBA business is in order. LA and Warriors are in. Houston is a bad NBA business if they came in in the playoffs. 😂😂😂😂😂
	Congrats
	well, today no complaining for free throws. Thanks GOD!
	The greatest player of all time vs the greatest walkout of all time 😂
	Splash night 💪Raining 3's🔥
	Anthony Davis is the only hope the Lakers have of even being competitive heading into the play-in.  If he don't play there is no hope whatsoever.  He is clearly their best player but the media won't allow anybody to admit this fact.
	Boss  congrats ✋😎
	Lakers referee tried their best to give fouls, but GSW threes are unbeatable 🥴
	In playoff time no team can beat this lakeshow championship roster comeon im just being honest lakers will win 2024 nba champions mark my word lets go enjoy a regular season win but in playoffs you cant beat lakers carry on🔥
	134 points, great defense.
	Best of 7 good luck shooting 3s at that clip to stay in the game. Haha
	Good win warriors dub Nation stand up
	Congratulations #30, you're the Goat! ❤️
	No defense was played in this game.
	Great Game warriors❤️
	Congratulations my WARRIORS team 👏👏👏
	Congratulations gsw 👏❣️🔥
	May i ask,when the playin tournament begin how many games is it?
	All hands on deck, where was AD??
	Congrats warriors. Soon to champion😄😄😄
	"Wow, what an incredible performance by Steph and the Warriors! Bringing 6 triples and leading the team to victory in LA is truly impressive. And shoutout to Klay Thompson for his 27 points and 5 3-pointers. LeBron James also had an amazing game with 33… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	24 vs 21 ft tonight. No 6th man ref help for the lakers. 🤪
	Most complete offense game this year
	I shoked D.Green
	Fantastic!
	Got obliterated in home court!
	Another good game for klay but the NBA keep snobing him
	Congrats warriors go the champion
	Grate game congratulations .
	Great win . Team threes
	Time for Steph other teammates to do their part. He has carried the team most of the season. They are wearing him out. Basketball is a team sport not an individual sport. Love ❤️ me some Step Curry. Let’s go Warriors ‼️
	Klay Thompson had a great game.. Need to acknowledge his performance.. 💪🏻🏀
	Klay has been so great the last few games, hope he keep on delivring performances like this for the postseason!
	Good luck and hello to all
	Anthony Davis didn't play!! Lebron 33 points 11 Assists, you 23 points 8 Assists , what is the greatest feat…..
	Great game Lakers. The Lakers are the best
	Congratulations LEBRON JAMES, A Awesome Game!!
	Good luck 👍🏾
	Glad to see Klay finding his rhythm.
	I’m still not convince they can win against a complete lakers team specially with AD and Vando playing..
	continues win of the last 3 games will change the place of the 7,8,9 seed
	Oh yeah YoHooo!! 🎉🎉🎉 hey u sTeph dude😅 you're hands are burning right now oh my goodness😎😅 you need my dude (Draymond Green) in your play so that my San Francisco Town😍🙏 will getting alive oh come on😁✌
	He is amazing  congrats steph God bless him
	But steph and the warriors r washed and stephs legacy is over cuz of draymond 😂🤭☠️
	Goodbye lakers for the play off
	Yeah my team warriors congrats gsw👏👏👏💪💪💪
	Great win. But looking at the stats on this post, seeing Lebron still putting up 30 points is remarkable.🙆‍♂️
	Give Some Love to Captain Klay for his 
	Green and klay keep this up and we definitely have a chance . Now winning a chip not happening we have no bench of old
	He works hard. Great team💯💯💯
	Awesome game way to go Warriors
	The Lakers needed 40 or more free throws to beat the Warriors
	Was a nice game. Loved it.
	Thank you Klay for the win..  go warriors to the 8 seed
	Still this 2 teams.facing each other in play in..
	Let’s Go Warriors
	let's go Warriors!! You can do this!!
	Great win!!!
	Great game!!  Go Warrior's ❤️

	The world is so silent hahaha. Now, it's proven and tested warriors is far greater than lakers. 
	laker vs refs congratulation refs
	AD is a big loss for them. If AD is healthy, maybe GSW &amp; Lakers will give us a good fight. Lakers is underman and Coach Steve Kerr know that.
	What a great day. Warriors win and Lakers losses.🤣🤣🤣
	Sleep well lakers😂
	The Splash team Warriors!!🥰🧐
	CONGRATULATIONS to both teams for an exciting game though Davis was absent. Let's enjoy watching James and Curry while they're still playing.
	 Dylanne 😘 sotroy zi papay 😂🤣
	Congratulations to all GSW fans! 💙💛
	Thank you GSW for winning the 10th place in west 😅
	Warriors 🤩🤩🤩🤩 Great win 👍👍
	they need to win all their remaining four games.
	It was a good game fasho 🤑
	it's ok, Lakers are still strong. Lakers all the way.  Let's Go Lakers. Lakernation.
	Battle for 10th seed
	Love how NBA playoffs don't announce who is starting until 1 hour before tipoff...every team every player is Game time decision anymore
	they can win with injured team and with refs help 🤣🤣🤣 greates shooter sometimes
	My favorite player in that order right there I’m not gone miss a shot not even go to the bathroom 😆 fr fr I can’t miss a chance to see Steph Curry in action
	Nice one dubs..keep on winning 
	GSW win
	LeBron can't get past Steph yet some of y'all believe he's better than Jordan! 🤣
	Steph is the side kick, while getting double teamed, and faceguarded, still being 77%fg, 100% from 3 near triple double, +13 and 1 TO... I'm just 32mins. aight, yall.. lol
	Ref try to be fair in the regular season matches.🤭
	Warriors need to rematch when Anthony Davis is actually playing. And Curry will need to pop off in that game. Will be a very interesting game to watch.
	To a record night for the warriors to overcome the Lakers no shot they go any further than Lakers
	Go warriors...........................⛹️⛹️⛹️
	Congratulations my gsw team
	Congratulations to the Golden State Warriors Warriors 🏀 team 😄🏀
	Lakers need AD role. So we know who's the bigger lakers role so far.
	Congrats idol
	 is too busy making friends with Draymond and yet he never mind getting beat by warriors because his close to them. That's why Jordan is the GOAT by far. Lebron is not competitive no killer instinct.
	Congratulations 👏 👏 👏 Warriors
	🎯🎯💯💯🔥🔥😍 congratulations Warriors!!!
	Congrats on securing 10th spot.
	Let’s Go Warriors
	Congrats GSW
	Congratulations gsw
	a blow out game? why is warriors opponent so weak? 😂😂
	Thank U Lord 4d grace of WIN,  Godbless Warriors more power.  To God be the GLORY.
	Gold Blooded Warriors 
	Golden state  is not a good match up for lakers trust me AD was playing  last nite golden calf  would  have loss
	A warrior home game is the worst thing they can do.
	Why are all warriors fans acting like they won 2024 championship??
	All these lakers vs refs comments 🤣🤣🤣🤣
	It's a shame our goats are getting old☹️
	Nobody wants to have to see the Lakers or the Warriors in a 7-game series.
	The media acts like Anthony davis isn't the best player on the lakers.
	Nuggets are still 15-0 against these two clowns since early 2022
	They both barely make the playoffs
	Congrats gsw
	Curry is the GOAT of this era 🐐❤️
	Go Warriors!!
	What a Game!! 👏👏
	Only if AD played lebron carried the team warriors always getting lucky
	The true is: Curry is better than Lebron
	Warriors loss in play-in versus Lakers,and that's the reality,mark my words,😂
	Congrats warriors nice win 👍
	Fr these games more exciting then Jokic whole career
	Let's go Warriors!😎👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
	Lebron and lakers just gave this win for the Warriors.
	Great game
	Congratulations keep the momentum on
	Great game lebron 33pts 11ast still dominating the league 💯💯
	nice win refs congrats
	Lakers vs. Ref..thats the game today...

	Needed Klay to have almost his best game of the year and AD to sit out lol
	Go golden state warriors
	Congrats team!!
	❤️❤️❤️
	gsw for the title
	Congrats gsw .
	GOO Steph! Go Warriors!
	I can hear Kendrick Perkins breathing heavy already 😅
	Hambog lebron..kobe its relax .haahah
	And Without AD? You know warriors are getting eliminated in first round if they make playoffs
	It takes a team to win. Lebron is not a team
	So what? If Lebron wants, he hit 9 / 9. In his age.
	A WAY TO GO STEPH AND WARRIORS
	Go Warriors💙💛🏀
	Greatest Shooter SC30 💛💙
	THANK YOU GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS.

	CHEF always insane, what a performance Again !
	Warriors is going NOWHERE. No ANTHONY DAVIS &amp; GREEN shooting almost 75% from Downtown is the only reason they won 😂😂😂😂
	Both these teams wont make it in the playoffs why bother? 
	GOAT players are MICHAEL JORDAN,LEBRON JAMES,KYRIE IRVING,LUCA DONCIC,JAYSON TATUM,GIANNIS ANTETOUKOMPO,KAWHAI LEONARD AND DONOVAN MICHELLE.👑💪🏀🏆❤️

	Refs were like ray Charles for the Lakers
	Go Warriors
	Wth lakers 🤣
	Laker's only win on warriors are a lucky one point overtime win. Lebron can't beat steph and the warriors in a play in match
	Battle for the 9th seed 😂
	Good man from
	Klay thompson is starting to be klay again good job warriors
	Steph Curry beat Lakers
	If only AD was there lakers would of get it done easily
	He should stick to that,    because Good Times ain't it
	Nice one there,let's go Warriors....
	And Draymond hits 5 threes!!
	Favored By God!!!
	That's all he does plus if he don't score he not a factor show us point guard not a ball chucker.
	only lebron the best king of loss in nba

	That’s our Steph
	🔥🙌🏾
	Curry, the best.
	Congratulations GWS 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏
	The LA intentionally gave the W to warriors to prevent them in remove in top 10
	Why curry on the picture he's only 23 points than Thompson got 27😆
	Good guys won
	Lets end the Bron era
	Fighting for 8th spot
	 can't even beat Curry then why there's a debate between him and Jordan? He can't even beat Steph?????
	Way to go Warriors. Can't wait for you to eliminate the Fakers and LeFlop in the play in. Go Steph.

	The 3PKing 👑
	Congrats
	Lakers badly needed AD to win.
	Great win. LA did not have Davis. Trayce Davis's defence left much to be desired. Need to position at the right place. Offence is ok. Take a cue from Green. They should have shown this intensity at the half way mark.
	That's good 💯
	Keep on going 🎊♥️🌹
	Fantastic Game awesome 3 Pointers Congratulations  👏🏀🏆
	How about Draymond’s five? Crazy.
	Steph shhhh congrtasssss ,I'm crying 😭

	Darvin Ham baffles me. AD is out, so you need to keep either LeBron or DLo on the floor at all times, the game was like 71-76 and he takes out both of them and the warriors end the quarter on a 10-0 run. Like what kind of coaching strategy is that?
	Congrats  and especially to  and to team  for the win but no matter what will be the result of your game i love your team
	Lebron James What A Awesome Game!!!♥️
	That guy is the purest shooter I’ve ever seen and I’m a bulls fan ! He can shoot from the parking lot ! 💯💯💯💯
	Dont matter??it aint gonna get him past who?lets see? Clippers? Mavs? Pelicans? Okc? The ANT?Timberwolves or THE JOKER and Denver let that sink in🤣😂🤣
