GSW	Congrats gsw
	See you in play in guys
	😁
LAL	As Lal-team fan..i just loved what i saw..finally Lbj going somewhere else &amp; reaves good addition for a certified star-player this off season..maybe, don't know how to defend bigs, J. Hayes also replace..good luck Lal-team for the play in tourn. Hopefully, they'll in #8seed from 9 so that they can afford to loss one game. So sad for back to back losses without AD the #6seed within reach..😢
	Great game GS! Let's win out!!
	Nahhhhh. Additional drama. The playoffs is complete. NBA business is in order. LA and Warriors are in. Houston is a bad NBA business if they came in in the playoffs. 😂😂😂😂😂
	well, today no complaining for free throws. Thanks GOD!
GSW	Congrats
	Splash night 💪Raining 3's🔥
GSW	🤣🤣
GSW	The greatest player of all time vs the greatest walkout of all time 😂
LAL	Anthony Davis is the only hope the Lakers have of even being competitive heading into the play-in.  If he don't play there is no hope whatsoever.  He is clearly their best player but the media won't allow anybody to admit this fact.
GSW	Boss ✋😎
LAL	Lakers referee tried their best to give fouls, but GSW threes are unbeatable 🥴
LAL	In playoff time no team can beat this lakeshow championship roster comeon im just being honest lakers will win 2024 nba champions mark my word lets go enjoy a regular season win but in playoffs you cant beat lakers carry on🔥
GSW	134 points, great defense.
	Brian Wright no defense
	Brian Wright hi
	Best of 7 good luck shooting 3s at that clip to stay in the game. Haha
	Lucas Hong they live and die by the 3. Also lucky shooting night by draymond. No AD also for lakeshow
	Good win warriors dub Nation stand up
	David Mccall hi
GSW	Congratulations #30, you're the Goat! ❤️
	No defense was played in this game.
	David Okiedoke hi
GSW	Great Game warriors❤️
GSW	Congratulations my WARRIORS team 👏👏👏
GSW	Congratulations gsw 👏❣️🔥
	May i ask,when the playin tournament begin how many games is it?
LAL	All hands on deck, where was AD??
GSW	Congrats warriors. Soon to champion😄😄😄
GSW	Wow, what an incredible performance by Steph and the Warriors! Bringing 6 triples and leading the team to victory in LA is truly impressive. And shoutout to Klay Thompson for his 27 points and 5 3-pointers. LeBron James also had an amazing game with 33… Wyświetl więcej
	24 vs 21 ft tonight. No 6th man ref help for the lakers. 🤪
	Most complete offense game this year
	I shoked D.Green
GSW	Fantastic!
GSW	Got obliterated in home court!
	Another good game for klay but the NBA keep snobing him
GSW	Congrats warriors go the champion
GSW	Congratulations Warriors for not giving up the 10th spot woohh 💀
GSW	Grate game congratulations .
GSW	Great win . Team threes
GSW	Time for Steph other teammates to do their part. He has carried the team most of the season. They are wearing him out. Basketball is a team sport not an individual sport. Love ❤️ me some Step Curry. Let’s go Warriors ‼️
GSW	Klay Thompson had a great game.. Need to acknowledge his performance.. 💪🏻🏀
GSW	Klay has been so great the last few games, hope he keep on delivring performances like this for the postseason!
	Good luck and hello to all
LAL	Anthony Davis didn't play!! Lebron 33 points 11 Assists, you 23 points 8 Assists , what is the greatest feat…..
LAL	Great game Lakers. The Lakers are the best
LAL	Congratulations LEBRON JAMES, A Awesome Game!!
GSW	Good luck 👍🏾
GSW	Glad to see Klay finding his rhythm.
GSW	I’m still not convince they can win against a complete lakers team specially with AD and Vando playing..
GSW	continues win of the last 3 games will change the place of the 7,8,9 seed
GSW	Oh yeah YoHooo!! 🎉🎉🎉 hey u sTeph dude😅 you're hands are burning right now oh my goodness😎😅 you need my dude (Draymond Green) in your play so that my San Francisco Town😍🙏 will getting alive oh come on😁✌
GSW	He is amazing  congrats steph God bless him
GSW	But steph and the warriors r washed and stephs legacy is over cuz of draymond 😂🤭☠️
LAL	Goodbye lakers for the play off
GSW	Yeah my team warriors congrats gsw👏👏👏💪💪💪
GSW	Great win. But looking at the stats on this post, seeing Lebron still putting up 30 points is remarkable.🙆‍♂️
GSW	Give Some Love to Captain Klay for his
GSW	Green and klay keep this up and we definitely have a chance . Now winning a chip not happening we have no bench of old
GSW	He works hard. Great team💯💯💯
GSW	Awesome game way to go Warriors
LAL	The Lakers needed 40 or more free throws to beat the Warriors
GSW	Was a nice game. Loved it.
GSW	Thank you Klay for the win..  go warriors to the 8 seed
GSW	Still this 2 teams.facing each other in play in..
GSW	Let’s Go Warriors
GSW	let's go Warriors!! You can do this!!
GSW	Great win!!!
GSW	Great game!!  Go Warrior's ❤️
LAL	Nearly crucial game Lakers always doiñg big dramà big issue look Lakers vs Minnesotà Lebron absent this game more value then làkers vs gsw A D absent how situation Lakers team now ,lebron said no more wasting time ,why Pelincà did not confirm this  lebron and AD big dramà  theñ Ham no have Expirience this crucial game ,big 4 people cancer Lakers  team, how to deserve championship ,Zero performance every season team owner lost big dollar
GSW	The world is so silent hahaha. Now, it's proven and tested warriors is far greater than lakers.
	laker vs refs congratulation refs
LAL	AD is a big loss for them. If AD is healthy, maybe GSW &amp; Lakers will give us a good fight. Lakers is underman and Coach Steve Kerr know that.
GSW	What a great day. Warriors win and Lakers losses.🤣🤣🤣
LAL	Sleep well lakers😂
	The Splash team Warriors!!🥰🧐
	CONGRATULATIONS to both teams for an exciting game though Davis was absent. Let's enjoy watching James and Curry while they're still playing.
	😘 sotroy zi papay 😂🤣
GSW	Congratulations to all GSW fans! 💙💛
GSW	Thank you GSW for winning the 10th place in west 😅
GSW	Lakers without AD. Easy win 😅
GSW	Warriors 🤩🤩🤩🤩 Great win 👍👍
GSW	they need to win all their remaining four games.
	It was a good game fasho 🤑
LAL	it's ok, Lakers are still strong. Lakers all the way.  Let's Go Lakers. Lakernation.
	Battle for 10th seed
	Love how NBA playoffs don't announce who is starting until 1 hour before tipoff...every team every player is Game time decision anymore
	they can win with injured team and with refs help 🤣🤣🤣 greates shooter sometimes
	My favorite player in that order right there I’m not gone miss a shot not even go to the bathroom 😆 fr fr I can’t miss a chance to see Steph Curry in action
	Nice one dubs..keep on winning 
GSW	GSW win
LAL	LeBron can't get past Steph yet some of y'all believe he's better than Jordan! 🤣
GSW	Steph is the side kick, while getting double teamed, and faceguarded, still being 77%fg, 100% from 3 near triple double, +13 and 1 TO... I'm just 32mins. aight, yall.. lol
	Ref try to be fair in the regular season matches.🤭
	Warriors need to rematch when Anthony Davis is actually playing. And Curry will need to pop off in that game. Will be a very interesting game to watch.
GSW	To a record night for the warriors to overcome the Lakers no shot they go any further than Lakers
GSW	Go warriors...........................⛹️⛹️⛹️
GSW	Congratulations my gsw team
GSW	Congratulations to the Golden State Warriors Warriors 🏀 team 😄🏀
	Lakers need AD role. So we know who's the bigger lakers role so far.
GSW	Congrats idol
GSW	LeBron James is too busy making friends with Draymond and yet he never mind getting beat by warriors because his close to them. That's why Jordan is the GOAT by far. Lebron is not competitive no killer instinct.
GSW	Congratulations 👏 👏 👏 Warriors
GSW	🎯🎯💯💯🔥🔥😍 congratulations Warriors!!!
GSW	Congrats on securing 10th spot.
GSW	Let’s Go Warriors
GSW	Congrats GSW
GSW	Congratulations gsw
GSW	a blow out game? why is warriors opponent so weak? 😂😂
	Thank U Lord 4d grace of WIN,  Godbless Warriors more power.  To God be the GLORY.
	Gold Blooded Warriors 
GSW	Golden state  is not a good match up for lakers trust me AD was playing  last nite golden calf  would  have loss
GSW	A warrior home game is the worst thing they can do.
GSW	Why are all warriors fans acting like they won 2024 championship??
LAL	All these lakers vs refs comments 🤣🤣🤣🤣
GSW	It's a shame our goats are getting old☹️
	Nobody wants to have to see the Lakers or the Warriors in a 7-game series.
LAL	The media acts like Anthony davis isn't the best player on the lakers.
	Nuggets are still 15-0 against these two clowns since early 2022
	They both barely make the playoffs
GSW	Congrats gsw
GSW	Curry is the GOAT of this era 🐐❤️
GSW	Go Warriors!!
LAL	What a Game!! 👏👏
GSW	Only if AD played lebron carried the team warriors always getting lucky
GSW	The true is: Curry is better than Lebron
	Warriors loss in play-in versus Lakers,and that's the reality,mark my words,😂
GSW	Congrats warriors nice win 👍
	Fr these games more exciting then Jokic whole career
GSW	Let's go Warriors!😎👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
LAL	Lebron and lakers just gave this win for the Warriors.

GSW	GOO Steph! Go Warriors!
	I can hear Kendrick Perkins breathing heavy already 😅
	Hambog lebron..kobe its relax .haahah
LAL	And Without AD? You know warriors are getting eliminated in first round if they make playoffs
LAL	It takes a team to win. Lebron is not a team
LAL	So what? If Lebron wants, he hit 9 / 9. In his age.
GSW	A WAY TO GO STEPH AND WARRIORS
GSW	Go Warriors💙💛🏀
GSW	Greatest Shooter SC30 💛💙

GSW	Warriors is going NOWHERE. No ANTHONY DAVIS &amp; GREEN shooting almost 75% from Downtown is the only reason they won 😂😂😂😂

	GOAT players are MICHAEL JORDAN,LEBRON JAMES,KYRIE IRVING,LUCA DONCIC,JAYSON TATUM,GIANNIS ANTETOUKOMPO,KAWHAI LEONARD AND DONOVAN MICHELLE.👑💪🏀🏆❤️

GSW	Happy for Klay.
GSW	The 3PKing 👑
GSW	Congrats
LAL	Lakers badly needed AD to win.
LAL	Great win. LA did not have Davis. Trayce Davis's defence left much to be desired. Need to position at the right place. Offence is ok. Take a cue from Green. They should have shown this intensity at the half way mark.
	That's good 💯
	Keep on going 🎊♥️🌹
	Fantastic Game awesome 3 Pointers Congratulations 👏🏀🏆
	How about Draymond’s five? Crazy.
	He'll ya
	Its a must win for them. Lucky theres no AD or they have no chance

GSW	Congratulations 🎊
LAL	A loss in your own court is a biggest disappointment #Emberesment
