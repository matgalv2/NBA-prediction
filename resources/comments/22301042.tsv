TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
SAC	Way to go Sabonis! 🙌🥳
SAC	Congratulations Domantas Sabonis! You have hustled, rebounded and shared dimes straight into NBA history!!! Incredible consistency and effort! Proud of you as a Lithuanian! Jėgaaaaa
SAC	His father wasn't a bad player either!
	Thomas Flynn wasnt a bad player? He was one of the best players to ever play the game. Disrespect will not be tolerated.
SAC	In English when we know that someone was an amazing player we use this expression as like a little joke, so no disrespect. Arvydas Sabonis was 100% one of the greatest of all time.
SAC	Insane player. Most underrated starter by far.
SAC	Go look at all his highlights crying every play 🗑 nba is just weak rn
SAC	Great accomplishment.  Unfortunately, the Lakers and Warriors are the only teams the media talk about, so he won't get the exposure he deserves.
SAC	But didn't make the all star team lol comical
	Kings vs Mavs in the next two consecutive games this week will be crazy.
SAC	Congratulations to Sabonis and Kings team on the victory!
SAC	I love our Sacramento 👑 Kingz!
SAC	Makes games so easy. Others can hardly do that. Stats if you want and winning!
SAC	Season leader in triple-doubles which is truly remarkable taking into account that he's not a player with a high usage rate. In fact, he is 83rd overall in usage rate ranking topped by Luka Doncic.
SAC	I always liked him. Tough, hard working team player that keeps on elevating his game.
SAC	I was there I said he gonna get 10 pt then work on 10reb and assist is a plus lol.
SAC	Low points but they counted big time
	Kat making the All Star over him was wild…
	David Hubert makes the voters look stupid as hell…
	David Hubert fr the All-Star game is a popularity contest and has nothing to do with skill level
	Reliable bigman indeed
SAC	He's going off
SAC	The best center in the league #gokings #lightthebeam #beamteam
SAC	💪💪💪
SAC	good
SAC	🌴
SAC	👑
SAC	🙌🏽
SAC	Great player
SAC	Remarkable
SAC	Somehow not an all star
SAC	"Nobody is calling it ""stat padding"" because he's not an MVP candidate or NBA champ ... once he accomplishes something, haters are gonna popup from everywhere 🤷‍♂️🤣"
	Jamal Ben Youdren Stat padding has been used already. Reason why people said he wasn't an all star.
	Jamal Ben Youdren you are so right...
	Wouldn’t do s##^ against Dwight Howard
SAC	Too embarrassed to mention the Have game😫
	And yet wasn’t an all star 🙄
	And then he and 3 of his teammates put up a sad shooting effort against the Mavs the next night.
SAC	Bout time you gave the man some recognition.
	Lets accept the Fact  that The GSW will just win if their Opponents are 
SAC	Congratulations to Domantas Sabonis 👏🏆👏🙂
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Sacramento Kings
SAC	Just 6 more double doubles (11 games left.  In 71 games he has 67 double doubles.) and he breaks dikembe mutombo's single season double double record, too.
	Unanimous All NBA 1st Team IMHO...
	What about the Celtics showing their playoff signature choke
SAC	Very Nice
SAC	His father humiliated Team USA
	🇱🇹🇱🇹🇱🇹
	Damien Srna
SAC	#MVP
SAC	This is who Anthony Davis thinks he is.
SAC	Maybe some day he’ll be an all star again.
SAC	Insane player. Most underrated starter by far.
SAC	Weak league to let this dude pull off records like that.
SAC	Mc triple-double 🙏
SAC	lovely
SAC	Love
SAC	Domantas Sabonis
	LTB
SAC	54? those are rookie numbers. pump those numbers up
	Orlando J Rodriguez
