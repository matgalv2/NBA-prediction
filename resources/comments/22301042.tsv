TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Way to go Sabonis! 🙌🥳
	Congratulations Domantas Sabonis! You have hustled, rebounded and shared dimes straight into NBA history!!! Incredible consistency and effort! Proud of you as a Lithuanian! Jėgaaaaa
	His father wasn't a bad player either!
	Thomas Flynn wasnt a bad player? He was one of the best players to ever play the game. Disrespect will not be tolerated.
	In English when we know that someone was an amazing player we use this expression as like a little joke, so no disrespect. Arvydas Sabonis was 100% one of the greatest of all time.
	Insane player. Most underrated starter by far.
	Go look at all his highlights crying every play 🗑 nba is just weak rn
	Great accomplishment.  Unfortunately, the Lakers and Warriors are the only teams the media talk about, so he won't get the exposure he deserves.
	But didn't make the all star team lol comical
	Kings vs Mavs in the next two consecutive games this week will be crazy.
	Congratulations to Sabonis and Kings team on the victory!
	I love our Sacramento 👑 Kingz!
	Makes games so easy. Others can hardly do that. Stats if you want and winning!
	Season leader in triple-doubles which is truly remarkable taking into account that he's not a player with a high usage rate. In fact, he is 83rd overall in usage rate ranking topped by Luka Doncic.
	I always liked him. Tough, hard working team player that keeps on elevating his game.
	I was there I said he gonna get 10 pt then work on 10reb and assist is a plus lol.
	Low points but they counted big time
	Kat making the All Star over him was wild…
	David Hubert makes the voters look stupid as hell…
	David Hubert fr the All-Star game is a popularity contest and has nothing to do with skill level
	Reliable bigman indeed
	He's going off
	The best center in the league #gokings #lightthebeam #beamteam
	💪💪💪
	good
	🌴
	👑
	🙌🏽
	Great player
	Remarkable
	Somehow not an all star
	"Nobody is calling it ""stat padding"" because he's not an MVP candidate or NBA champ ... once he accomplishes something, haters are gonna popup from everywhere 🤷‍♂️🤣"
	Jamal Ben Youdren Stat padding has been used already. Reason why people said he wasn't an all star.
	Jamal Ben Youdren you are so right...
	Wouldn’t do s##^ against Dwight Howard
	Too embarrassed to mention the Have game😫
	And yet wasn’t an all star 🙄
	And then he and 3 of his teammates put up a sad shooting effort against the Mavs the next night.
	Bout time you gave the man some recognition.
	Lets accept the Fact  that The GSW will just win if their Opponents are 
	Congratulations to Domantas Sabonis 👏🏆👏🙂
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Sacramento Kings
	Just 6 more double doubles (11 games left.  In 71 games he has 67 double doubles.) and he breaks dikembe mutombo's single season double double record, too.
	Unanimous All NBA 1st Team IMHO...
	What about the Celtics showing their playoff signature choke
	Very Nice
	His father humiliated Team USA
	🇱🇹🇱🇹🇱🇹
	Damien Srna
	#MVP
	This is who Anthony Davis thinks he is.
	Maybe some day he’ll be an all star again.
	Insane player. Most underrated starter by far.
	Weak league to let this dude pull off records like that.
	Mc triple-double 🙏
	lovely
	Love
	Domantas Sabonis
	LTB
	54? those are rookie numbers. pump those numbers up
	Orlando J Rodriguez
