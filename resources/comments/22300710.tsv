TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	3rd straight wins for the #thunder!!! 5 players scored 20+ in the win, led by giddey!!! #thunderup
	Down 23 and roared back, I wouldn't want to play OKC in the playoffs
	Randy McDaniel  what’s the team they play? Isn’t the  4th of the last in western?
	Randy McDaniel why okc always blows it in the playoffs  okc going no where
	Dort, Wiggins and Giddey deserve credit for this win. They came up huge in the 2nd half.
	Mike Underwood

	Mike Underwood yes but understand, shai got those stats while being double teamed the whole game. It left the others wide open for shots. That’s why he had 14 assists
	This Thunder team is looking good. They have a young confident group who has a balanced attack. SGA is the leader and MVP candidate. To come back from 23 without second option Jalen Williams says alot.
	Michael Carteryes
	SGA will be this season's MVP.
	Serkan Karatepe what was the final score
	Eric Brown 135-127  ⬆️
	Gary Sammons thanks
	Down 23 with 6 minutes left in the 3rd 🔥🔥

	Playing great team basketball.
	Scottie barely touched the ball in overtime, we could have won the game.
	"""first round exit"""
	Roy Butler how are the eagles doing?
	Roy Butler 2nd round exit
	Roy Butler PhiLLLLLy take
	Roy Butler 
	Roy Butler OKC has zero chance vs Denver in the playoffs. And the Champs aren't 💩
	Jared Herrera hmmm, they swept Denver IN Denver and are 3-1 against them already this season. 🤷🏼‍♂️
	Roy Butler so true
	Overrated player of the year!
	Rostom Jefferson who?
	Connor Strange who you think?
	Rostom Jefferson Led Canada to their first medal in the World Cup / World Championships.
	James MacGregor  But they are not champion so?
	Rostom Jefferson neither were the USA, last year.  Your point being?
	Rostom Jeffersonreally
	James MacGregor  points is   Your SGA is overrated  just get a help from refs
	Rostom Jefferson biggest hater on the page right here.
	Rostom Jefferson nope that’s Luka.
	Russell Rutledge luka and him the same
	Now that embidd is ineligible for the highest individual award in the league...this kid should be MVP.
	ALison Pacania it’s between him and Jokic. Possibly Giannis. 
	ALison Pacania 
	ALison Pacania still jokic
	ALison Pacania Luca
	Steve Armour 
	ALison Pacania 
	ALison Pacania too early to pick a winner, he is getting lot of consideration.
	I've watched it on YouTube nice game, Josh Giddey &amp; Shai G is on fire in this match up to 2nd OT congrats OKC
	Congrats SGA and team Oklahoma .. get winner in the game

	cant believe he was once a clipper look at him now can any one say mvp i can
	Ken Sweeneyunbelievable
	RJ should have held the ball after getting the rebound, instead of putting it on the floor to dribble in finally 5 seconds of the game. He had to free throws coming to seal the game.
	Roderick Reddick

	Giddey still underrated on this team
	Maitland Bezzina I like his game. His numbers are down this year. His size and skills are a rare combination.
	Defense
	Bounce Back Raptors 😭
	"I just noticed that those people that are always commenting ""first round exit/second round exit"" in these NBA posts are stupid bandwagon filipino fans that know nothing about basketball they are jealous to the top teams because their teams are 💩"
	Roy Butler pretty much
	Roy Butler because their Lakers and GSW teams are not in the top seed.
	Say it with me...MVP MVP MVP!
	You even watch this game NBA? Miss Giddey’s in-bound pass?

	Congratulations to the Thunder
	OKC when Holgrem and SGA be health,then is OKC a Favorit for the Championchip,by Holmgren is this allways a Risiko
	SGA, Chet, and Giddey gonna dominate
	Nick Smith J dub didn’t even play we banged up
	Nick Smith Raptors were keeping Shai out of the paint, this game was won by Wiggins and that 3rd quarter run.
	SGA is a fckn BEAST, he did so many miracles on their clutch game against the Raptors.🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪👍
	So good to see Giddey finally finding his rhythm again
