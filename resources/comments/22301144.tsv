TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	The momentum definitely on the side of the MAVS 
	One goal 🏆
	Keith Sison fact
	The new face of the NBA for the next decade.
	And Stephen A. not having Luka in his top 5 MVP this year is ridiculous! Give him his respect! He deserves to be the MVP this year!
	The addition of Kyrie has made the Mavs a depth team but they are just a beatable team. They can be defeated by anyone in playoffs even in their first round.
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	If Luka does not win MVP this year, the league is rigged.
	MVP 
	Way to go Luka!! You are awesome!!! You make the game so exciting!!!! Win again tomorrow!!!
	Wow, what a dominating performance by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks! Their 4th straight win is a true testament to their hard work and determination. And let's not forget the impressive stat lines from Kyrie Irving and Brandon Miller. This team … Wyświetl więcej
	At some point though in order to win or be considered one of the greatest,  he will have to start playing defense. Love Luka,  but dude is 100% a one way player.
	Should be another fun Clippers vs Mavs series 🔵🔴⚪️🏀
	If he don’t win mvp idk what to say bro deserves it
	If Mavs win 50 games, you have to give the guy the MVP. No more reasons or excuses why he can’t win it.
	Ian M Santos yup. We rally if luka dont win mvp and a ring
	The basketball player who never defends. It's simple: we'll never see a DONCIC defensive TOP 10. He can't defend.
	Nicolas Nsr like all other superstars ? 
	Mavs are cooking. Not my team but they are rolling into the playoffs hot as hell. Whoever gets them first round could be in trouble
	He should be the MVP this season
	What else does he have to do to win the MVP?
	Denver has better role players . Luke deserves MVP
	Dudes gonna average 34/10/9 and not even win an MVP smh
	Clearly the MVP
	The Don MVP this year
	James Ayala jokic,look odds
	Branko Bane Savic  yes the odds favor Jokic but statistically and impact it should be Luka
	James Ayala nope, luka only have more pts..jokic advances stas is way better..per,%,+_...lover used rate..luka have only 7 pts more for 7 more shoots per game thats not great
	Branko Bane Savic  true but remember Jokic is on a better team top to bottom ..
	James Ayala jokic not have even all star teamates,he make them better
	Branko Bane Savic  no doubt ,  Jamal Murray should’ve been an all star 
	James Ayala  jammal every season miss 25 hames at least..not too much help for Jokic
	Branko Bane Savic  all great points both are deserving
	The more weight luka has put on since his rookie season, the better he has played😆
	Give him the mvp man
	I'm a huge Jokic fan, and I'm one of those who thinks he should've been MVP last year as well, but at least he got it in the playoffs. But this year Luka has been balling and improved so much in defense it's almost unreal. I guess that's what becoming a father does to you 😳
	LUKA MAGIC MVP!!!
	There will be historical moment when his average stats will be triple double, he is almost close to do it. Lets go Luka 🔥🔥
	It would have been nice if he and Kyrie both had a triple double. It wasn’t that far away.
	Was there to witness!  Luka is one of a kind ever, elite in so many ways
	If the Hornets had better training than the roody poo workouts they do, they would be better.
	Sameer Winferd he out here looking like he just drank a case of beer and decided to show up for the game
	Best player on the planet
	Hoping one day we can have a super star like that in Charlotte.  #beastmode
	Go Mavs 😎 #WeOnAMission
	Win it all Let’s GO MAVS!!! Championship #2 🏆🏆
	Mans knees was just bleeding yesterday 🤯
	MVP this lad for sure…
	mvp!
	Mvp fosho
	Congrats mavs team
	Handed it
	MVP Luka he deserves it this year.
	Mbow Mentality Mbomba its jokic and its over
	As a nuggets fan, Luka is absolutely ballin this year and i can’t be mad if he stole mvp. Still think it will go to joker but Doncic has a strong case.. SGA been showing out too
	Not a big Luka fan. But LeBron couldn't hold his jockstrap so how can he be the goat?
	Why is he still playing and not resting for the playoffs?
	Come to dallas wemby
	Hope to see u in 2nd round..
	Hope to see a championship ring in your finger.
	Luka looks like a teenage gamer that only comes out of his room to eat something 😂
	I barely even saw him play tonight. Did that in minimal minutes. MVP
	MVP❄️
	Nothing can stop mavs now 👌
	Mvp by far
	Luka Magic ✨
	Fantasy nba doesn't work
	What is the of the NBA now
	Dallas Mavericks Vs Charlotte Hornets
	First round exit
	Dallas will get this year championship... LA will not as long as lj don't retire..
	Atlanta Hawks trade trae young for Luka Doncic 😂😂😂

	beating up on poverty settle down there brother ☝🏼 Josh Broes
	Don’t forget gafford shooting 100%
	Mvp
	Luv it 😊😊
	Luka looks like he is in a donuts dietary supplement 😂
	The Hornets should trade for very good and competent players next season. 19-60 is a tragedy; it's a disaster!
	8 3pm 🙌 i wonder if 10 would've made it a Quadruple Double 👑
	So what  Brunson has another 40
	Dark Horse #MFFL💪🏾🐴
	Mavs are gonna be a problem in the playoffs

	This Dallas team is my favorite to make the finals. They are hot at the right time and I just don't see a team that's going to keep up with them
