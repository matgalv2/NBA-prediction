TEAM_ID	COMMENT
	The momentum definitely on the side of the MAVS 
	 fact
	And Stephen A. not having Luka in his top 5 MVP this year is ridiculous! Give him his respect! He deserves to be the MVP this year!
	 SAS is a punk. If you aren’t black he doesn’t consider you.
	 tu ídolo está en sótano 😂
	 Stephen A is racist
	 Stephen A hates Eastern Europeans
	The new face of the NBA for the next decade.
	 hi do you mind having a conversation with me
	 he doesn’t respond to skanks
	 faxxx
	 guess you forgot about the guy from the spurs
	 who?
	 deez
	 you mean the guy at the bottom of the conference with 20 total career wins? That guy?
	Travis Uebel talking about Wenby who is a great player as a rookie and needs to earn his place while playing for a team in the bottom 5 in the league?
	 too bad he moves around the flow like a snail (a very effective snail I know)
	 maybe if he wins chip
	If Luka does not win MVP this year, the league is rigged.
	fr
	 If Brunson don’t win MVP, rigged
	 I guess it’s rigged cause Joker is winning it
	 he pads stats all the time.
	 if that the case then Wemby should get DPOY
	 JOKCI IS THE REAL MVP
	Wes Dromgoole it’s already  rigged lol look at the bucks vs Celtics game earlier 😆
	 jokic will be..its over look odds
	 He won't, Jokic has already got it in the bag. I wish Luka would get it though.
	 fact
	The addition of Kyrie has made the Mavs a depth team but they are just a beatable team. They can be defeated by anyone in playoffs even in their first round.
	 we shall see. Dems like your team is probably one on the bubble and you are grasping at straws hoping then can beat the Mavs
	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
	 LeBron already been back to back mvp and final appearance what has Luca done
	 hello dear
	Jonel Campuso uy barbie sabi ko na 🤣 tigil mo na kaka chupa mo puro burat nasa loob nang utak mo gago 🖕
	 just facts bro
	 stay off the crack
	 you tripping Luka is my favorite player and I’m no lbj fan but lebrons the goat and anyone who says otherwise is a real hater
	Heating up at the right time. 15 of last 17. Team has awesome chemistry. And even Nick Wright has said he was wrong on the Luka X Kyrie duo.
	MVP 
	  Jajjajaja 
	 jokic is just humble and doesn't care about winning MVP. Everyone knows jokic is the mvp this year and last
	 jokic is just humble and his friend..jokic is mvp its over look odds
	 jokic is better.
	 both deserve to be the MVP but Luka is in a historical stats &amp; his team is winning also.
	", Luka is a more versatile player. So if you ask people outside ’ who you want to be as an NBA player’, nobody will Say Jokic..hh.. they will say Jordan, James, Iverson, Doncic, Bird, and so on.. so I think Luka has many more skills overall t… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 jokic is carrying his team alone. Murray was out for a long time. In the other hand Doncic is being helped also by kyrie irving. Look @ his numbers.
	Jonathan Esparza overall jokic is better already won a championship. He play better defense. Jokic was without murray for more than 25 games this season while doncic less than 15 without kyrie. 
	 Jokic doesn't care, he is aiming another Chip...
	 it’s cause jokic doesn’t care about the mvp award he only wants to win.
	Way to go Luka!! You are awesome!!! You make the game so exciting!!!! Win again tomorrow!!!
	 need some extra cash? Slide in dm with Cashtag!
	"Wow, what a dominating performance by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks! Their 4th straight win is a true testament to their hard work and determination. And let's not forget the impressive stat lines from Kyrie Irving and Brandon Miller. This team … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 relax it’s only the Hornets that don’t even have 20 wins on the season.
	 Hello can we be friends If you don't mind?
	If he don’t win mvp idk what to say bro deserves it
	Should be another fun Clippers vs Mavs series 🔵🔴⚪️🏀
	At some point though in order to win or be considered one of the greatest,  he will have to start playing defense. Love Luka,  but dude is 100% a one way player.
	If Mavs win 50 games, you have to give the guy the MVP. No more reasons or excuses why he can’t win it.
	 yup. We rally if luka dont win mvp and a ring
	 haha what will be will be. Just a basketball fan speaking my mind on what Im seeing:)
	 actually with how lukas performing, along with bruce irving, he deserves that mvp trophy.
	The basketball player who never defends. It's simple: we'll never see a DONCIC defensive TOP 10. He can't defend.
	 that’s why he drops 30+ each game, because NBA is so well known by it’s defends😂
	" dude, why would he be a top 10 defender, if he is an ELITE offensive player?! You are being ridiculous! 😂  His defensive rating (113.9) is even better than Tatum (110.2), Jokic (110.3), SGA (110.5), Giannis (113.2).... Ofc, he is not a good… <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 that’s a really old narrative. Watch the games
	 at least watch some Mavs games before saying anything.
	 like all other superstars ? 🤣
	 Giannis ?
	 lol, I guess you're not following this year's defense stats because he's top 10 in almost all categories 😳
	 casual
	  why risking a scoring superstar player by making him fouled out?  Let other player defend. Winning is all matters.
	 he’s top 10 in steals and the mavs as a whole are top 2 defensively. This ain’t the same mavs from the past few years bro.
	Mavs are cooking. Not my team but they are rolling into the playoffs hot as hell. Whoever gets them first round could be in trouble
	He should be the MVP this season
	Dudes gonna average 34/10/9 and not even win an MVP smh
	What else does he have to do to win the MVP?
	 have a team in first place
	 Sounds like Embitch...
	 Well what he has to do, he has no control over so…
	Denver has better role players . Luke deserves MVP
	"I'm a huge Jokic fan, and I'm one of those who thinks he should've been MVP last year as well, but at least he got it in the playoffs. But this year Luka has been balling and improved so much in defense it's almost unreal. I guess that's what becoming … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	The more weight luka has put on since his rookie season, the better he has played😆
	The Don MVP this year
	Give him the mvp man
	Clearly the MVP
	Triple double ou triple cheese ? Il est tellement fort alors qu’il est clairement en surpoids .. incroyable
	There will be historical moment when his average stats will be triple double, he is almost close to do it. Lets go Luka 🔥🔥
	LUKA MAGIC MVP!!!
	Was there to witness!  Luka is one of a kind ever, elite in so many ways
	If the Hornets had better training than the roody poo workouts they do, they would be better.
	Best player on the planet
	It would have been nice if he and Kyrie both had a triple double. It wasn’t that far away.
	Hoping one day we can have a super star like that in Charlotte.  
	Mans knees was just bleeding yesterday 🤯
	Go Mavs 😎 
	Win it all Let’s GO MAVS!!! Championship #2 🏆🏆
	MVP this lad for sure…
	  he out here looking like he just drank a case of beer and decided to show up for the game
	Mvp fosho
	Cómo te amó!! 💓😍
	mvp!
	Congrats mavs team
	MVP Luka he deserves it this year.
	As a nuggets fan, Luka is absolutely ballin this year and i can’t be mad if he stole mvp. Still think it will go to joker but Doncic has a strong case.. SGA been showing out too
	So fat to be NBA player , but he Is good
	Not a big Luka fan. But LeBron couldn't hold his jockstrap so how can he be the goat?
	Why is he still playing and not resting for the playoffs?
	Hope to see u in 2nd round..
	Dombili
	Hope to see a championship ring in your finger.
	Mvp mvp mvp mvp

	Can't wait until he's a nugget!
	What did Williams do??
	This bloke looks about 2 cheeseburgers away from looking like you  haha  
	 We both have the same ability at basketball as well guns
	kyrie also big on defense 5 stocks
	  o tesouro é inchado igual eu, deve tomar umas kkkkkkkk
	 Ele tá só com o mesmo probleminha que vc, usando um tamanho menor de camiseta… 🤣🤣🤣
	 kkkkkkkkk tive essa discussão com gordo que ele não é atleta, se fosse ia ta voando muito mais 😂
	 ele é craque, joga demais… Seloco
	 Já vi um comentário que lá nos EUA comparam ele bastante ao Larry Bird, que também não era muito atlético mas também jogava demais. O estilo de jogo deles é parecido até.
	 Eu acho que logo que ele passar dos 30 já vai começar a ter bastante lesão, o corpo não aguenta! Tomara que não, mas acho que não existe almoço grátis.
