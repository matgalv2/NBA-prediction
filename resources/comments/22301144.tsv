TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DAL	The momentum definitely on the side of the MAVS
DAL	One goal 🏆
	Keith Sison fact
DAL	The new face of the NBA for the next decade.
DAL	And Stephen A. not having Luka in his top 5 MVP this year is ridiculous! Give him his respect! He deserves to be the MVP this year!
DAL	The addition of Kyrie has made the Mavs a depth team but they are just a beatable team. They can be defeated by anyone in playoffs even in their first round.
DAL	Lebron never did this kind of stats in his entire career.. this man absolutely better than bron, this is just my opinion. No hate ❤️
DAL	If Luka does not win MVP this year, the league is rigged.
DAL	MVP
DAL	Way to go Luka!! You are awesome!!! You make the game so exciting!!!! Win again tomorrow!!!
DAL	Wow, what a dominating performance by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks! Their 4th straight win is a true testament to their hard work and determination. And let's not forget the impressive stat lines from Kyrie Irving and Brandon Miller. This team … Wyświetl więcej
DAL	At some point though in order to win or be considered one of the greatest,  he will have to start playing defense. Love Luka,  but dude is 100% a one way player.
DAL	Should be another fun Clippers vs Mavs series 🔵🔴⚪️🏀
DAL	If he don’t win mvp idk what to say bro deserves it
DAL	If Mavs win 50 games, you have to give the guy the MVP. No more reasons or excuses why he can’t win it.
DAL	Ian M Santos yup. We rally if luka dont win mvp and a ring
DAL	The basketball player who never defends. It's simple: we'll never see a DONCIC defensive TOP 10. He can't defend.
	Nicolas Nsr like all other superstars ? 
DAL	Mavs are cooking. Not my team but they are rolling into the playoffs hot as hell. Whoever gets them first round could be in trouble
DAL	He should be the MVP this season
DAL	What else does he have to do to win the MVP?
DAL	Denver has better role players . Luke deserves MVP
DAL	Dudes gonna average 34/10/9 and not even win an MVP smh
DAL	Clearly the MVP
DAL	The Don MVP this year
DAL	James Ayala jokic,look odds
DAL	Branko Bane Savic  yes the odds favor Jokic but statistically and impact it should be Luka
DAL	James Ayala nope, luka only have more pts..jokic advances stas is way better..per,%,+_...lover used rate..luka have only 7 pts more for 7 more shoots per game thats not great
	Branko Bane Savic  true but remember Jokic is on a better team top to bottom ..
	James Ayala jokic not have even all star teamates,he make them better
	Branko Bane Savic  no doubt ,  Jamal Murray should’ve been an all star 
	James Ayala  jammal every season miss 25 hames at least..not too much help for Jokic
	Branko Bane Savic  all great points both are deserving
DAL	The more weight luka has put on since his rookie season, the better he has played😆
DAL	Give him the mvp man
	I'm a huge Jokic fan, and I'm one of those who thinks he should've been MVP last year as well, but at least he got it in the playoffs. But this year Luka has been balling and improved so much in defense it's almost unreal. I guess that's what becoming a father does to you 😳
DAL	LUKA MAGIC MVP!!!
DAL	There will be historical moment when his average stats will be triple double, he is almost close to do it. Lets go Luka 🔥🔥
DAL	It would have been nice if he and Kyrie both had a triple double. It wasn’t that far away.
DAL	Was there to witness!  Luka is one of a kind ever, elite in so many ways
CHA	If the Hornets had better training than the roody poo workouts they do, they would be better.
DAL	Sameer Winferd he out here looking like he just drank a case of beer and decided to show up for the game
DAL	Best player on the planet
DAL	Hoping one day we can have a super star like that in Charlotte.  #beastmode
DAL	Go Mavs 😎 #WeOnAMission
DAL	Win it all Let’s GO MAVS!!! Championship #2 🏆🏆
DAL	Mans knees was just bleeding yesterday 🤯
DAL	MVP this lad for sure…
DAL	mvp!
DAL	Mvp fosho
DAL	Congrats mavs team
DAL	Handed it
DAL	MVP Luka he deserves it this year.
	Mbow Mentality Mbomba its jokic and its over
DAL	As a nuggets fan, Luka is absolutely ballin this year and i can’t be mad if he stole mvp. Still think it will go to joker but Doncic has a strong case.. SGA been showing out too
DAL	Not a big Luka fan. But LeBron couldn't hold his jockstrap so how can he be the goat?
DAL	Why is he still playing and not resting for the playoffs?
DAL	Come to dallas wemby
DAL	Hope to see u in 2nd round..
DAL	Hope to see a championship ring in your finger.
DAL	Luka looks like a teenage gamer that only comes out of his room to eat something 😂
DAL	I barely even saw him play tonight. Did that in minimal minutes. MVP

DAL	Luka looks like he is in a donuts dietary supplement 😂
CHA	The Hornets should trade for very good and competent players next season. 19-60 is a tragedy; it's a disaster!
DAL	8 3pm 🙌 i wonder if 10 would've made it a Quadruple Double 👑
	So what  Brunson has another 40
