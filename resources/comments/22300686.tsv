	no embiid, no problem for the #sixers, as tyrese maxey puts on a show, scoring a new career high (51 points) to their victory!!! wow!!! 🙂
	Pinoy Ako we can read
	I feel like someone posting here could net 40 in today’s NBA
	Scott Kruitbosch you'd be lucky to get to the 3 point line, scrub
	"Denzel Carmine ""Let me be a total insecure humorless twat when someone jokes about how others like me could score 40"""
	Scott Kruitbosch humor for a joke that's been repeated millions of times by the NBA community for the last like 4 years lol now I've heard everything.
	Scott Kruitbosch if you were riding a bike the chain would have come off you’re backpedaling that hard now 😂
	Scott Kruitbosch yeah it ain't too late to just delete all this, jokes are usually funny and yours ain't
	Scott Kruitbosch joke supposed to be funny
	Scott Kruitbosch I feel like with all these guys dropping 30 to 40 points and all the 120 plus games lebrons scoring title won't last very long.
	Scott Kruitbosch 
	Scott Kruitbosch Yep.
	Scott Kruitbosch which is how good the league is these days. Everyone can stretch the floor now and it's much faster paced. Is defense as good as it could be? Nooooooot even close, but to think a team of 90s/80s ball players could shut down a modern team is wild. Offenses and defenses are way more complex now and teams were much slower paced decades ago and didn't look to shoot all that much. Many more restrictions in the older generation. Don't get me wrong though. I miss scores of 95-90, etc.
	Philadelphia 76ers Vs Utah Jazz
	Anjo Nathaniel Comaling
	At this pace embiid won't qualify for the mvp trophy
	Lebogang Letsoalo Good.
	Lebogang Letsoalo so what? He wants a championship now. Clown.
	Superstar in the making Sixers are lucky to pick him in the draft
	congrats sixers 127 jazz 124
	Krismarken Rondolo 
	Looks like a highschool kid. Only reason I know it's not is there's more defense played in highschool.
	Keith Tiffany Allgood LOL kids also can't score that well overall in high school. Kids shooting threes but bricking free throws. High school kids are trying to mimic NBA players way too much these days.
	Where is embiid?
	Robby Smith, Steve Smith, wow. I called this one.
	T-Max is on fire🔥💪
	T-Max is on fire🔥💪7
	At 23 Maxey is already a greater basketball player than Lebron was at 23 💯💯
	Goatman23 LeBron already made the Finals at 22, and a scoring champ at 23. Let's see Maxey do that.
	Goatman23
	Goatman23 so funny
	Goatman23 At 23 Maxey is already a greater basketball player than Jordan was at 23 💯💯
	Rey Mirontos facts right here
	Tyrese Maxey
	Ante Boban kako ti i rekoh, Utah neće izdržati utrku, evo ih sve više gube. Phila ih dobila bez Embiida, Covingtona, Batuma, Morrisa, a Jazz kompletan bio 🤷‍♂️
	Edževid Ecko Redžepović ima Utah dovoljno kvalitete da i bez njih dobije ekipa ala Utah...
	Thank you Tyrese  Maxey
	Miguel Son Bayang Iligan 
	That's why tanking during the process  was stupid : 21st pick
	Tyrese Maxey
