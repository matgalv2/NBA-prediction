TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	the #magic bounced back with a win, sending the #knicks to their 4th straight defeats!!! congrats 🙂
	Knicks were literally missing 7 players LOL SMH. Keep that same energy when the Knicks get fully healthy.
	Michael William Cassidy cry
	Jorge Rosario Nah. Knicks are still in 4th place even though they’re missing half the team. We’re good,thanks anyway though.
	Michael William Cassidy from the looks of it your celebrating to early being 4 a lot could happened all the way trough April 14 stop deal with it.?
	Jorge Rosario Once the Knicks get fully healthy then we’ll see. For the time being they’re in a great position in 4th place heading into All-Star break,that’ll give them time to rest and get healthy. Not even a little bit worried.
	Michael William Cassidy Magic 3-0 vs Knicks this year 🤣 when they were healthy ijs
	Michael William Cassidy this is the third time we beat the Knicks. Last time we held Randle to 15 points. 
	Aaron Haaland Last time Brunson didn’t even play. And the first time the officiating was terrible. But it is what it is. The Knicks were missing half the team tonight. Still in 4th place in a great position,not worried at all.
	Michael William Cassidy the officiating is often terrible. Who knows where the Magic will end up post season, we’ve been all up and down the standings. But it’s possible we’ll play the Knicks 1st round.
	Aaron Haaland Nah that’s not gonna happen. Once the Knicks get healthy they can move up to 2 or 3rd seed. Magic will most likely finish as a play in tournament team.
	Michael William Cassidy we’ll see. Play in is way better than we were last year though.
	Aaron Haaland it is.
	Michael William Cassidy 3-0 bing bong
	Todd Cyganov Knicks are in 4th place,Magic are in 8th place. BING BONGGGGGGGGG
	Michael William Cassidy magic were missing players as well
	Victor Rosa III Magic were pretty much fully healthy. But it’s all good,it’s 1 game. Knicks are still in a great position in 4th place,Magic are in 8th place.
	Michael William Cassidy Knicks are definitely having a good season. Magic are not going for it this season. According to Paolo the goal was to finish in the top 6 and top 3 in defense.

	This is not fair we are down players they should give us a break 😔🏀😔🏀 Knicks need to protest these games bad calls, playing the magic that not fair 😔😔 😔🏀🏀🏀
	Magic put some licks, mixed tricks, on the heartbreaking Knicks-away from Madison Garden-less chicks, according to critics! I watched with none refundable, ticket.

	The future is brighy for this Kid
	Have the Knicks won a game since the trades
	Fabian Scantlebury no, but they have a lot of injuries. Just double team Brunson and u got your win.
	Let’s Go Magic 🪄
	Love those throwback Magic jerseys
	Lorraine Hornsby 😄
	Great win from the Magic! I’m sure they learned a lot from their mentor Kai Sotto! 😤😤😤 #LetKaiPlay 😡
	This is sad only because every knowledgeable Knicks fan knows we're not losing 4 in a row with a full and healthy team. We were on a tear and nobody wanted that smoke with NY....even the refs playing dumb at our expense 🤨🤔😒
	Calvin Byer respectfully, the Magic have clearly wanted the smoke since they are 3-0 against NY this season.
	Daniel Martin DeLoa I'll give the Magic credit. We can't win them all. Injuries are a b#@!#🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
