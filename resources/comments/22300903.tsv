	He played like a man possessed! And he’s gonna have to play like that in the playoffs.
	Jon Reyeskat will be back for 1st round
	Thomas Noreen doubtful they said he'll be reevaluated in a month. It's a knee injury guarantee he won't. Both my knees are fucked so I am pretty sure he is out for the season based on my experiences.
	Joe Rutherford he tore his meniscus which is a 4-6 week injury he’ll be back at end of year or sooner
	Thomas Noreen it depends how bad it is. Not all tears are the same. Trust me. I've torn everything but my acl's. Not saying it's impossible for him to come back but it's definitely more thsn 4 weeks
