	If only the MAVS have a much better record
	MAVS are Balln winners of 7 of 8 moving into the 6th spot in the West... there jelln at the right time..
	 like a mf… Irving has found the fountain of youth
	 Luka would rather have the chip than MVP
	 he's the best Player this season. No doubt. Without him, Dallas is nothing
	 he is 3rd in MVP race now
	 he already is in mvp convo, if they were top3 seed there wouldnt be discussion this year
	 he is
	 Luka IS the MVP despite record
	4 steals, that looks like defense to me
	 he’s rated at the top of his position for defense which is crazy because people constantly say he doesn’t play defense
	 he doesn’t play defense
	 he literally does. Try watching a game first before commenting
	 I watched and played real ball Luka defense is terrible clearly you don’t know what your watching 😂😂
	 💯
	 Who plays serious  defense in NBA?
	 Mavs getting cohesive.
	 don’t say that too loud. It doesn’t fit the hater narrative
	 really dear
	 do you watch the guy play?
	Yes luka is in the Top 10 in steals in the league today.. people does not know that
	
	 can you send me friend request
	If Mavs go on a big winning streak and some how end up getting 50 wins+ I can’t see how Luka doesn’t get his MVP, he’s been consistent all year the team is 3 - 6 without him playing, and this has been his best year in the league statistically he’s improved his efficiency, scoring, and defense.
	 he only beat Jokic once this season not a few times and it was a buzzer beater by kyrie.
	 did you not see the 3 that tied the game a few seconds before? He misses that 3 they’re going home, Kyrie misses that layup it’s going overtime both clutch but let’s not act like Luka didn’t contribute to that win lol
	 you said he has best him a few times this season and that’s a lie
	There you are mate fixed it for you 😂
	
	All I know is they can’t beat Denver in a 7 game series. That win was on a lucky shot.
	
	 what ever moron
	" When you have Luka in the team everything is possible,you can ask Suns fans two years ago, when they were the best team in the league how they finished in the seventh game in Phoenix  and this year Luka has Kyrie , 2 big man in  Gafford and … <div class=""x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0"">Wyświetl więcej"
	 Tying 3 from Luka.

	The deep state hates Luka. Should be mvp
	 if you're the 8th seed how valuable are you? Winning matters
	Should be leading MVP but NBA hates him
	 Top 3
	 SGA
	 maybe but jokic is clearly mvp this season
	 due to lack of defense maybe?
	 tanga mo 4 steals nga eh, pakamatay ka nang hayup ka binuhay ka pa ng nanay mo 🖕🖕🖕
	 People love to ride this narrative into the ground. Luka has improved on defense this year, stats prove it. Besides, people are criticizing Jokic's defense too, but that didn't stop him from winning the MVP 2 times. The thing that holds Luka back is the team he plays on. Mavs is not an elite team like the Nuggets, Celtics, Bucks etc.
	 Give them a decent wing and center they're good
	If luka did this his averages would drop🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
	The NBA needs to give the man MVP well deserved
	Sometime skills will not be stopped. Luka is not from passed he is new
	These teams have opposite records. Nice.
	Great Win
	Luka is a great player
	Luka Doncic
	Utah Jazz Vs Dallas Mavericks
	What a game
	Chaud 🔥
	Good job Mavs ❤

	If only the MAVS have a much better record
	Imagine if Luka decided to hit the gym
	"The argument was ""he's not in the top 6"", what is the agenda now?"
	Congrats to Dallasin❤️❤️
	Idk how he doesn't average more you can't get close to the guy
