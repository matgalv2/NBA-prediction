	If only the MAVS have a much better record
	4 steals, that looks like defense to me
	#MVP💕
	If Mavs go on a big winning streak and some how end up getting 50 wins+ I can’t see how Luka doesn’t get his MVP, he’s been consistent all year the team is 3 - 6 without him playing, and this has been his best year in the league statistically he’s improved his efficiency, scoring, and defense.
	The deep state hates Luka. Should be mvp
	If luka did this his averages would drop🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
	The NBA needs to give the man MVP well deserved
	These teams have opposite records. Nice.
	Sometime skills will not be stopped. Luka is not from passed he is new
	Great Win
	Luka is a great player
	Chris Paynter really dear
	Utah Jazz Vs Dallas Mavericks
	What a game
	Good job Mavs ❤
	Congrats  mavs
	#ooptroop
	MVP
	-3 😂
	If only the MAVS have a much better record
	Imagine if Luka decided to hit the gym
	Congrats to Dallasin❤️❤️
	"The argument was ""he's not in the top 6"", what is the agenda now?"
	Good job...LD77
	Idk how he doesn't average more you can't get close to the guy
	This cat can hoop! 🔥

	Irving
