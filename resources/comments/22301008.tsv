DAL	If only the MAVS have a much better record
DAL	4 steals, that looks like defense to me
DAL	#MVP💕
DAL	If Mavs go on a big winning streak and some how end up getting 50 wins+ I can’t see how Luka doesn’t get his MVP, he’s been consistent all year the team is 3 - 6 without him playing, and this has been his best year in the league statistically he’s improved his efficiency, scoring, and defense.
DAL	The deep state hates Luka. Should be mvp
DAL	If luka did this his averages would drop🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
DAL	The NBA needs to give the man MVP well deserved
	These teams have opposite records. Nice.
DAL	Sometime skills will not be stopped. Luka is not from passed he is new
