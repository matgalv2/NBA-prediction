TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
DEN	Having triple-double is kinda typical to Jokic. Then, 100% FGs? Wow. Another Jokic thing. 👏
	Anne Jo next 0 turnovers
	Jyle Franz Villanueva Cayabyab maybe👍
DEN	Anne Jo it’s Washington.. worst team in the league basically..
	David Dillard so you mean to say, when you're playing against the worst team..it'll be easy for you to achieve that 100% FG? 🤔
	Anne Jo easier yes.. nothing is easy..
	David Dillard then, you are great 👏
DEN	Congrats Nuggets, great win. Excellent performance by Jokic with his 16th triple double this season, MVP2024 and the best center right now.
	Robbed of last year's MVP. Should have been his 4th straight by now
WAS	He's lucky Jordan Poole was benched 😤😤
	Toto Kevin
	An impressive Triple Double Stat with 100% FG 🤯
	Precioso Yunting Pioquinto Jr. and 50% ft
DEN	Just give him the 2nd place MVP then. SGA is the MVP
	The Best no.15 of Nuggets👏👏👏
	Went to the free throw line 1 time
DEN	Prediction, jokic runner up to mvp sga. Second round exit to clippers. Denver is great but clippers are better this year. Simple as that
WAS	I think the most shocking stat here is that the Wizards were somehow the only team he hadn’t triple-doubled??
WAS	100% is insane
	Definitely one of the top 10 players in the league
DEN	Congrats Nuggets! The joker doing it all he can for his team.
DEN	Just give this man his Mvp award he is too good
DEN	Dude is insane
DEN	Bruh, I can't wait for the playoffs. Sh*t's going to be 🔥🔥🔥
	When I switch the difficulty to Pro in MyPlayer.
WAS	9-46 is more impressive. Couldn’t imagine a professional team to be that bad.
DEN	If MVP voting wasn't controlled by ESPN narratives this man would be on his 4th MVP award season in a row now.
DEN	Jokic for MVP. TD with 100% FG is a feat that can't be replicated.
	Danielson Culaniban he's already done it twice...this year lol
	Joshua Zeigler yeah. I didn't realize that. Still impressive though. Thanks.
DEN	4x consecutive MVP for a reason, the Joker !
DEN	The Real GOAT of the NBA HISTORY
DEN	It's just a job - Joker
DEN	Best player in the league and it's not even close
DEN	Carmelo getting more angry watching  Jokic do what he does !
	Gotta get him some comp
	Remember when Kyle Kuzma said don't be that team to the pistons the wizards have 1 more win and 1 less lose the the Pistons 🤣🤣🤣
	What other player has this amount of games with 100% field goals in a single season??
	Chad Self dude is a beast ! Should have 3 mvp going for 4
DEN	Back to back champion 🏆🏆 for Denver 💪
DEN	Greatest basketball player ever !
DEN	Best player in the league by far 👏 👌 🙌
DEN	100% from the field while doing this is insane
DEN	He only makes triple-doubles against Wizards, Pistons or Spurs. LOL.
	Lebig Mcfit please 🙄 He averaged a triple-double in the playoffs.
	Lebig Mcfit you mean teams against Embiid playing at road? (He miss top teams)
DEN	That is elite force. He will be remembered as one of the best with that stat.
DEN	Best point center in the entirely galaxy💪💪💪💪
DEN	GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME
	This guy has not even reached his ceiling yet!!
DEN	this dude don’t even care about basketball and still stuffing the stat sheets, imagine if he cared about it like he did his horses
	Remember when Bobby Boucher showed up at half time and the mud dogs won the bourbon bowl?
	Drew MacLachlan thank you all for being my friend 🤣
DEN	What would Perk say about this? He's stat padding again. 😂😂😂
	Ice Cube had the same stats on Today Was A Good Day.
DEN	I love Jokic but does it even matter anymore? I mean pretty soon every team will shoot 80% for an average game.
DEN	Triple Double on a 100% from the field is just NUTS
DEN	Nikola jokic is real MVP triple double not embiid 70 pts
DEN	Jokic with triple double @100% 2x this season🤯. This is the reason why Jokic led the all time PER, he surpassed MJ🐐.
DEN	When you have productive teammates, it makes you look great and your job easier…why is this simple logic is so complex for many to understand that🤦🏽‍♂️
WAS	Washington Wizards playing worse than a G league team ffs 😂😂😂
DEN	THE JOKER HAS CREATED HIS OWN GOTHAM CITY ON THE COURT THE BEST CENTER IN NBA AT DIS POINT TD AND D D  HE HAS DONE IT AGAINST ALL CONGRATS JOKIC KEEP BALLIN GOD BLESD NBA AND NIKOLA FOREVER ALWAYS PEACE👏😯😉👌✌👍🙏🏻💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
DEN	Only cares about what it takes to win. A true champion and says a lot about him as a person. Nice work
WAS	I know Kuzma giving us I wanna win in Washington but the man deserves better and should definitely look to leave next season....🎯💯😬
	Jordan poole had one hell of a game 😮‍💨
	the wizards almost had this game
	Anybody who thinks Embid should have got the MVP last year instead of this man Don't know much about basketball.
DEN	Just another day in the office for Jokic
	They was playing a 9 win team. It would be impressive if he did this against the Boston Celtics or a better team.
	Imagine being 9-46 😳 that's a lot of losing.. if you're a fan you must be dedicated
	Nate Monigold Thank you for the kind words. Its been a disaster this season 🙏
DEN	Wonderful job, Jokic! Keep helping the Nuggets rise to number 1, and take the 2nd straight championship!
DEN	The triple double is Good..
	Like this 
DEN	That guy is absolutely amazing.   He's more dangerous that kobe or Mike.  That guy is just soo dam good.
DEN	He is obviously better than Embiid, but the League doesn't want to give him his 3rd MVP in a row. This year is Doncic time to be robbed.
DEN	The only team he hasn’t done that is… Nuggets…🤣🤣
DEN	Such an underrated player. I don't know why he gets any hate.
DEN	This guy is better than LBJ. currently, and all time. If anybody will dethrone MJ it's Joker. He's on pace to be top 3 all time.
DEN	He made it look so effortless . Best player in the league
DEN	Fundamentals beats athleticism most of the time.
DEN	The King of Triple-Double - The Joker
DEN	best player in the word🤣🤣🤣
DEN	And his favorite sport is horse racing😂🤣
	Ban this duo now 😂😂
	He is the new Russ Westbrook
	He’s not gonna win MVP. He absolutely should, but he’ll get robbed again for a feel good story or a flashier guy.
WAS	Kyle Kuzma “don’t be that team” when talking about the pistons lol their records look very similar today
	Maybe he should get tested for substances with that performance like Donovan Mitchell did.
	Wow, crazy game from the Joker. And 19 rebounds, not bad for someone who doesn't like to jump 😂
	And still not multiple mvp is crazy tho🤧
	This dude is awesome
DEN	Jokic keep on improving. He'll become a beast with this kind of stat
DEN	Maybe soon he will surpass lebron's greatness and will be the second greatest player of all time behind MICHAEL JORDAN.
	The NBA us just 2k MyLeague IRL at this point
	why do outlets keep wording it this way? is there a team he hasn't faced?
	Guess you can do that against a team 9~46. But the never missed a shot . Thats cool
	100% 😲😲
	Man it’s the Washington Wizards. Beating them is not an accomplishment. They can get beat by a high school JV team on any given night!
DEN	Only 100% field goal percentage? Come on. Do better. 😂😂
	Calm down it was against the wizards lol Let me see him do that against the top team in the east
DEN	I no longer get surprised when I see a monsterouse triple double from Jokic, it's an everyday thing to him.
DEN	Mvp without any doubt!
DEN	Great player..
WAS	Kuzma don’t care to win as long as he’s the “man” of that team
	Individual stats with winning result is still the best post!
DEN	What a phenomenal player 👏👏👏
DEN	From this one. He is clearly to win MVP .
WAS	Kyle Kuzma was great, 31 points, 13 rebounds and 6/8 3pm.
	dude didn't missed!? 💀
	The defense in this era: 💀💀💀
DEN	Doncic, Jokic, Sabonis.
DEN	Joker the allstar game is over
	Nba in 2030 ? If you defend you got A Technical foul
DEN	Insane accomplishment!! 💪🏾🏀💯
DEN	On his way to lead the Nuggets to another Championship.
DEN	Well he is this years MVP !!!
DEN	J15 The real MVP 👑
DEN	And he wants Luka with him🤯 if that happens the league is finished ✅.. joker is that nigga.
DEN	Triple double and 100% jeeez
DEN	Jokic can easily on top against Westbrook's triple double
WAS	Kuzma really said no I wanna stay on this 9-46 team.
	Joker piling up triple doubles nice win Denver
	Did he beat cp3 record?
	He and Aaron are friends for life.
	Needs to join Luka in Dallas and Get one vs Nuggets
WAS	That teams 9 and 46 about time 💀
DEN	Almost a double triple-double. Impressive regularity Mister Jokic! 👍
WAS	these people really have only won 9 out of 55 games....that's incredible
WAS	Damn seeing 9-46 hits different from just hearing it sheesh
	Against the wizards who only have 9 wins
DEN	100 💯 percent. Jokic ace it…😀
WAS	The Wizards though....,
	Damn that's some hard stats
	He'll probably the 3rd to get 20-20-20. After Wilt and Westbrook.
	The true MVP
DEN	Good job Congrats 🏀🏀🏀
	Washington is not NBA
	Against the Wizards, it literally doesn't count
DEN	His stats are not normal bro this is some 2k shit 😅
	Poole RN with the record of 9-46:
DEN	15assist and that's for a center position lol crazy
DEN	Wow and didn't miss a shot either that's insane
DEN	Now those are impressive MVP numbers from Jokic.
DEN	Dang. 15 assist on top of 21 points. Is this Playstation gaming? Haha.
	After this, still thinking about his horse
DEN	Incredible. Expecting a 20/20/20 night from Joker in the near future.
	Means that bro connected on all his shots
WAS	9-46 is wild 🤣
	They're going back to back.
	Magic is back playing center except this guy can shoot better.
DEN	100% FG? 🤯🤯🤯
	The best ❤️❤️
	Big up and long live
	This is one of the craziest stat lines I have ever seen
DEN	Super efficient
DEN	This is not a human
DEN	Is he the first to do it while shooting 100%?
	Only on tv game does
	Clippers are coming for y’all!!!
	Gordon 361 shoes
	It's this numbers lotto or what
DEN	Bravo  !!!!!!!!!!!
DEN	Wait did he not miss a shot? Impressive
DEN	Wow big triple double ahh
	you need a magician not a wizard😂
DEN	The most dominant NBA player today
	100% WHAT?
DEN	Go Nuggets!
	All for his horse
DEN	Congrats to the joker
	😮‍💨 9-46 is crazy
DEN	Yes yes 🔥
DEN	Sweet both my teams won
	🇷🇸J🏀O🏀K🏀A🏀R🏀A🇷🇸

	Fred shaina told you they be balling never bet against them
DEN	Bro is a machine
DEN	Mr. Triple Double ⛽️🔥💯
DEN	Big baller brand
DEN	King of Triple-double 👑
DEN	Indeed, the Denver Nuggets have shown remarkable prowess on the court, and their victory is well-deserved. The way they played the game, with a blend of strategy and skill, is commendable:
	cool, but it was against the wizards. that almost shouldn’t count
WAS	Historic night for the Wiz has they have yet to find their tenth win in this dumpster fire of a season
	Light work
DEN	Kid's pretty good 😉
	I had him and   Luka for the triple double and maxey over 30….MF luka was one rebound short of making me rich 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
DEN	Triple Double Kings
DEN	That is amazing.wow
DEN	Amazing
	Washington Wizards Vs Denver Nuggets
DEN	Well well well
	Now it's not stat padding when the yt man doing it lol
DEN	Wow... This dude is... Something else. He's the league's best player right now, no matter what people say. He's amongst the best players that ever stepped on the court, no doubt.
	Media , the NBA 
	How many free throws? (Just asking not hating)

	Who even watches this boring man sink in every shot? 100 FG% percentage? It's not what the kids want to see, give them some bricks and felonies so they can learn about life!!!
	For real. Less queen lebron bullshit and more of the REAL stars of the league!!!
