TEAM_ABBREVIATION	COMMENT
	Having triple-double is kinda typical to Jokic. Then, 100% FGs? Wow. Another Jokic thing. 👏
	Anne Jo next 0 turnovers
	Jyle Franz Villanueva Cayabyab maybe👍
	Anne Jo it’s Washington.. worst team in the league basically..
	David Dillard so you mean to say, when you're playing against the worst team..it'll be easy for you to achieve that 100% FG? 🤔
	Anne Jo easier yes.. nothing is easy..
	David Dillard then, you are great 👏
	Congrats Nuggets, great win. Excellent performance by Jokic with his 16th triple double this season, MVP2024 and the best center right now.
	Robbed of last year's MVP. Should have been his 4th straight by now
	He's lucky Jordan Poole was benched 😤😤
	Toto Kevin
	An impressive Triple Double Stat with 100% FG 🤯
	Precioso Yunting Pioquinto Jr. and 50% ft
	Just give him the 2nd place MVP then. SGA is the MVP
	The Best no.15 of Nuggets👏👏👏
	Went to the free throw line 1 time
	Prediction, jokic runner up to mvp sga. Second round exit to clippers. Denver is great but clippers are better this year. Simple as that
	I think the most shocking stat here is that the Wizards were somehow the only team he hadn’t triple-doubled??
	100% is insane
	Definitely one of the top 10 players in the league
	Congrats Nuggets! The joker doing it all he can for his team.
	Just give this man his Mvp award he is too good
	Dude is insane
	Bruh, I can't wait for the playoffs. Sh*t's going to be 🔥🔥🔥
	When I switch the difficulty to Pro in MyPlayer.
	9-46 is more impressive. Couldn’t imagine a professional team to be that bad.
	If MVP voting wasn't controlled by ESPN narratives this man would be on his 4th MVP award season in a row now.
	Jokic for MVP. TD with 100% FG is a feat that can't be replicated.
	Danielson Culaniban he's already done it twice...this year lol
	Joshua Zeigler yeah. I didn't realize that. Still impressive though. Thanks.
	4x consecutive MVP for a reason, the Joker !
	The Real GOAT of the NBA HISTORY
	It's just a job - Joker
	Best player in the league and it's not even close
	Carmelo getting more angry watching  Jokic do what he does !
	Gotta get him some comp
	Remember when Kyle Kuzma said don't be that team to the pistons the wizards have 1 more win and 1 less lose the the Pistons 🤣🤣🤣
	What other player has this amount of games with 100% field goals in a single season??
	Chad Self dude is a beast ! Should have 3 mvp going for 4
	Back to back champion 🏆🏆 for Denver 💪
	Greatest basketball player ever !
	Best player in the league by far 👏 👌 🙌
	100% from the field while doing this is insane
	He only makes triple-doubles against Wizards, Pistons or Spurs. LOL.
	Lebig Mcfit please 🙄 He averaged a triple-double in the playoffs.
	Lebig Mcfit you mean teams against Embiid playing at road? (He miss top teams)
	That is elite force. He will be remembered as one of the best with that stat.
	Best point center in the entirely galaxy💪💪💪💪
	GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME
	This guy has not even reached his ceiling yet!!
	this dude don’t even care about basketball and still stuffing the stat sheets, imagine if he cared about it like he did his horses
	Remember when Bobby Boucher showed up at half time and the mud dogs won the bourbon bowl?
	Drew MacLachlan thank you all for being my friend 🤣
	What would Perk say about this? He's stat padding again. 😂😂😂
	Ice Cube had the same stats on Today Was A Good Day.
	I love Jokic but does it even matter anymore? I mean pretty soon every team will shoot 80% for an average game.
	Triple Double on a 100% from the field is just NUTS
	Nikola jokic is real MVP triple double not embiid 70 pts
	Jokic with triple double @100% 2x this season🤯. This is the reason why Jokic led the all time PER, he surpassed MJ🐐.
	When you have productive teammates, it makes you look great and your job easier…why is this simple logic is so complex for many to understand that🤦🏽‍♂️
	Washington Wizards playing worse than a G league team ffs 😂😂😂
	THE JOKER HAS CREATED HIS OWN GOTHAM CITY ON THE COURT THE BEST CENTER IN NBA AT DIS POINT TD AND D D  HE HAS DONE IT AGAINST ALL CONGRATS JOKIC KEEP BALLIN GOD BLESD NBA AND NIKOLA FOREVER ALWAYS PEACE👏😯😉👌✌👍🙏🏻💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
	Only cares about what it takes to win. A true champion and says a lot about him as a person. Nice work
	I know Kuzma giving us I wanna win in Washington but the man deserves better and should definitely look to leave next season....🎯💯😬
	Jordan poole had one hell of a game 😮‍💨
	the wizards almost had this game
	Anybody who thinks Embid should have got the MVP last year instead of this man Don't know much about basketball.
	Just another day in the office for Jokic
	They was playing a 9 win team. It would be impressive if he did this against the Boston Celtics or a better team.
	Imagine being 9-46 😳 that's a lot of losing.. if you're a fan you must be dedicated
	Nate Monigold Thank you for the kind words. Its been a disaster this season 🙏
	Wonderful job, Jokic! Keep helping the Nuggets rise to number 1, and take the 2nd straight championship!
	The triple double is Good..
	Like this 
	That guy is absolutely amazing.   He's more dangerous that kobe or Mike.  That guy is just soo dam good.
	He is obviously better than Embiid, but the League doesn't want to give him his 3rd MVP in a row. This year is Doncic time to be robbed.
	The only team he hasn’t done that is… Nuggets…🤣🤣
	Such an underrated player. I don't know why he gets any hate.
	This guy is better than LBJ. currently, and all time. If anybody will dethrone MJ it's Joker. He's on pace to be top 3 all time.
	He made it look so effortless . Best player in the league
	Fundamentals beats athleticism most of the time.
	The King of Triple-Double - The Joker
	best player in the word🤣🤣🤣
	And his favorite sport is horse racing😂🤣
	Ban this duo now 😂😂
	He is the new Russ Westbrook
	He’s not gonna win MVP. He absolutely should, but he’ll get robbed again for a feel good story or a flashier guy.
	Kyle Kuzma “don’t be that team” when talking about the pistons lol their records look very similar today
	Maybe he should get tested for substances with that performance like Donovan Mitchell did.
	Wow, crazy game from the Joker. And 19 rebounds, not bad for someone who doesn't like to jump 😂
	And still not multiple mvp is crazy tho🤧
	This dude is awesome
	Jokic keep on improving. He'll become a beast with this kind of stat
	Maybe soon he will surpass lebron's greatness and will be the second greatest player of all time behind MICHAEL JORDAN.
	The NBA us just 2k MyLeague IRL at this point
	why do outlets keep wording it this way? is there a team he hasn't faced?
	Guess you can do that against a team 9~46. But the never missed a shot . Thats cool
	100% 😲😲
	Man it’s the Washington Wizards. Beating them is not an accomplishment. They can get beat by a high school JV team on any given night!
	Only 100% field goal percentage? Come on. Do better. 😂😂
	Calm down it was against the wizards lol Let me see him do that against the top team in the east
	I no longer get surprised when I see a monsterouse triple double from Jokic, it's an everyday thing to him.
	Mvp without any doubt!
	Great player..
	Kuzma don’t care to win as long as he’s the “man” of that team
	Individual stats with winning result is still the best post! 
	What a phenomenal player 👏👏👏
	From this one. He is clearly to win MVP .
	Kyle Kuzma was great, 31 points, 13 rebounds and 6/8 3pm.
	dude didn't missed!? 💀
	The defense in this era: 💀💀💀
	Doncic, Jokic, Sabonis.
	Joker the allstar game is over
	Nba in 2030 ? If you defend you got A Technical foul
	Insane accomplishment!! 💪🏾🏀💯
	On his way to lead the Nuggets to another Championship.
	Well he is this years MVP !!!
	J15 The real MVP 👑
	And he wants Luka with him🤯 if that happens the league is finished ✅.. joker is that nigga.
	Triple double and 100% jeeez
	Jokic can easily on top against Westbrook's triple double
	Kuzma really said no I wanna stay on this 9-46 team.
	Joker piling up triple doubles nice win Denver
	Did he beat cp3 record?
	He and Aaron are friends for life.
	Needs to join Luka in Dallas and Get one vs Nuggets
	That teams 9 and 46 about time 💀
	Almost a double triple-double. Impressive regularity Mister Jokic! 👍
	these people really have only won 9 out of 55 games....that's incredible
	Damn seeing 9-46 hits different from just hearing it sheesh
	Against the wizards who only have 9 wins
	100 💯 percent. Jokic ace it…😀
	The Wizards though....,
	Damn that's some hard stats
	He'll probably the 3rd to get 20-20-20. After Wilt and Westbrook.
	The true MVP
	Good job Congrats 🏀🏀🏀
	Washington is not NBA
	Against the Wizards, it literally doesn't count
	His stats are not normal bro this is some 2k shit 😅
	Poole RN with the record of 9-46:
	15assist and that's for a center position lol crazy
	Wow and didn't miss a shot either that's insane
	Now those are impressive MVP numbers from Jokic.
	Dang. 15 assist on top of 21 points. Is this Playstation gaming? Haha.
	After this, still thinking about his horse
	Incredible. Expecting a 20/20/20 night from Joker in the near future.
	Means that bro connected on all his shots
	9-46 is wild 🤣
	They're going back to back.
	Magic is back playing center except this guy can shoot better.
	100% FG? 🤯🤯🤯
	The best ❤️❤️
	Big up and long live
	This is one of the craziest stat lines I have ever seen
	Super efficient
	This is not a human
	Is he the first to do it while shooting 100%?
	Only on tv game does
	Clippers are coming for y’all!!!
	Gordon 361 shoes
	It's this numbers lotto or what
	Bravo  !!!!!!!!!!!
	Wait did he not miss a shot? Impressive
	Wow big triple double ahh
	you need a magician not a wizard😂
	The most dominant NBA player today
	100% WHAT?
	Go Nuggets!
	All for his horse
	Congrats to the joker
	😮‍💨 9-46 is crazy
	Yes yes 🔥
	Sweet both my teams won
	🇷🇸J🏀O🏀K🏀A🏀R🏀A🇷🇸
	Well he had to win after losing to his father Sabonis
	Fred shaina told you they be balling never bet against them
	Bro is a machine
	Mr. Triple Double ⛽️🔥💯
	Big baller brand
	King of Triple-double 👑
	Indeed, the Denver Nuggets have shown remarkable prowess on the court, and their victory is well-deserved. The way they played the game, with a blend of strategy and skill, is commendable:
	cool, but it was against the wizards. that almost shouldn’t count
	Historic night for the Wiz has they have yet to find their tenth win in this dumpster fire of a season
	Light work
	Kid's pretty good 😉
	I had him and   Luka for the triple double and maxey over 30….MF luka was one rebound short of making me rich 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
	Triple Double Kings
	That is amazing.wow
	Amazing
	Washington Wizards Vs Denver Nuggets
	Well well well
	Now it's not stat padding when the yt man doing it lol
	Wow... This dude is... Something else. He's the league's best player right now, no matter what people say. He's amongst the best players that ever stepped on the court, no doubt.
	Media , the NBA 
	How many free throws? (Just asking not hating)
	Keepthebeat kiedy ocierasz się o perfekcje, czas na cześć 2. Pozdro.
	Wojtek Węgrzyn Przemek Wojtkowiak Michał Janus against EVERY team. I to przy 100%FG, no wariat.
	"A supportive message for those in our state dealing with tax or bill issues – chime in with a ""GOD DID,"" and the first four responders might just find a boost of 5 grands coming their way!"
	He just need to do it against the nuggets now..lol
	The prince of Serbia
	These niggas only won 9 games wtf 😂😂😂😂
	Best player in the league
	Ramon Walker i know it’s against Washington. But nobody else ever produced and puts up the numbers this guy does
	"A supportive message for those in our state dealing with tax or bill issues – chime in with a ""GOD DID,"" and the first four responders might just find a boost of 5 grands coming their way!"
	Who even watches this boring man sink in every shot? 100 FG% percentage? It's not what the kids want to see, give them some bricks and felonies so they can learn about life!!!
	For real. Less queen lebron bullshit and more of the REAL stars of the league!!!
	31 points | 13 rebounds | 3 rebounds | 6 3 points, a good result.

	Best player in the league. I know y’all are mad
	Should be on his way to his 4th straight MVP 😳 but the woke NBA wouldn't allow that because they would consider it racist.
